The noodle (thinner and finer than most ramen places) was fresh but I prefer the more traditional size and texture. The broth was good but it didnt knock my socks off. I think Dojo/Santa/Maru in the Bay area probably compare better on taste and depth of flavor. That said, I wasn't dying of thirst afterwards (no MSG?) We ordered appetizer of Samurai Rib, Bakuretsu Tofu and Hirata Bun. Of the three, I liked the Samurai Rib the most. Bakuretsu Tofu is cute. Like Korean jigae but a little out of place as it competes with the ramen if you plan to have ramen. The Hirata bun wasn't too special. Momofuku's pork buns are probably better (from what I recall). It gets stars for the vibe, decor, and service. Net net ... I dont think I would wait in line to pay $14 for ramen again.</td>\n",

I was told 15 minute wait so I walked outside because of the crowd inside and not even 2 minutes later someone came out and called my name, guess I got lucky. I had just before that got donuts from the Doughnut Plant and had my bag, the girl said that they dont allow outside food but courteously told me I can bring it in just dont show it off. All the service was very quick and I never had an empty cup. This place is just on par with daikakuya in L.A. but better because for the ambiance and courteous/speedy service.

We arrived early (for brunch standards) and only had to wait about 15-20 mns and even had some bench space.  We did have to share our table (communal) but that's ok.  It's large/wide enough to accomodate several parties at once.  The only thing is you end up next to those with you and not across from them.  So unless you're going w. a large group, be ready to share space. *Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri (Japanese cucumber mixed with sesami oil dressing): this we got from seeing a high recommendation on a friend's yelp.  Wow.  This was amazingly good and wondrously addicting.  I mean how do they keep the cucumber so crisp?  How is the sauce so light yet packs such flavor?  How do I recreate this delicious and yet so simple dish??  After we finished I wished we had ordered 2 or 3.  Next time... *Hirata Buns (Steamed buns filled w. pork and served w.

It has a nice, club-like feel to it without the loudness associated with a club. The food is great. We started with the most popular appetizer, the pork buns. Good stuff. The pork had sirachi and a bit of a kick, but it wasn't overwhelming, which was appreciated. I had the \"Classic\" and while I thought the meat was a little tough, the ramen was tasty enough to make up for it. It snowed outside while we waited for a table. The snow was so bad that it felt like I was being poked and prodded by a bunch of icy needles whenever it hit unprotected skin. As a result, we had to take a cab home.</td>\n",

We arrived on a Saturday afternoon, and the cashier told us we would have an 1.5 hour wait, but we were eased when they said they would give us a call 20 minutes before our table was ready. What to do from there? Take a trip to SoHo and get some shopping done! Sure enough, we did receive a call and by the time we came back to Ippudo, our table was ready. From the moment you enter in the actual dining area to the moment you leave, it's quite the experience.

Without even tasting the ramen, I was already impressed by the ramen  bowl that was size of my face. It came with a equally large soup spoon to match. The key to great ramen is the soup. So I tentatively took a small sip. The flavors just exploded in my mouth! It was savory with just right amount of salt. The pork was moist and also perfectly seasoned. All my previous doubts were washed away with each additional bite of the perfectly chewy noodles and soup.

Well lucky for The Gap, they got my after Christmas money while I was waiting for my table. Fast forward - place is medium size, not giant and not the super small place that traditional ramen places used to be. Their lunch meal deal is GREAT.  It comes with salad, rice with your choice of topping, I recommend the eel.  YUM!  Giant bowl of ramen.  Delicious.  We also ordered the pork buns, but I'm not a fan of mayo in my pork buns. I would definitely recommend!</td>\n",

I've been here probably about 3 times but I always order the karaka ramen, that's preferably the best thing on the menu. I've tried others such as modern and such and such from tasting it from my friends plate.     I'd have to say the ramen is here is not great, but not bad, but your probably be getting the same kind of ramen if you were to go to Santoka in Mitsuwa.  Also their appetizers are great such as the tako wasabi probably the best and freshest i had in NY. Their pork buns are good too, but the only thing is that these appetizers are way overpriced. I usually go with 2 people with appetizers, ramen and drinks usually comes up to over 100. That's pretty expensive in my opinion. I thought ramen was suppose to cheap.</td>\n",

I had the Akamaru Modern and it was delicious, especially with the pork belly. The fact that they allowed a refill on ramen was even better. I definitely was full by the end of the night. The wait was worth it. The environment here is very cozy and warm especially after the cold winter that we waited outside in. The dark ambiance was very attractive and the fact that we got to see the cooks do their thing, it was nice. I liked the walls that had the hiragana. It was a nice touch and it's made of foam. They're actually the names of the people who had a hand in either making Ippudo a reality or their financiers. I don't remember, but it was a very nice touch. I also liked the paper paintings located between the tables in the back and the bar. I recommend coming here at least one time. This is the best ramen I have ever tasted so f...</td>\n",

And this place does it *well.* First things first, the wait is out of control, but I knew that so we put our name in and went for a walk.  I called about 35 minutes later to check in and they let me know it was just about time to head back.  We went back and were seated within 5 minutes. I love the decor, and the way they use the chairs with arms on one side to partition off the pairs of diners around the big table in the middle. I ordered the shisito peppers as a starter, and really enjoyed them with the yuzu salt for dipping.  I did feel they were a little oilier than versions I've had at other places, probably because they are fried rather than grilled.  I think I prefer grilled, as you get that blackened outer skin that is very satisfying. My companion had the tonkatsu classic, which was very, very good.  Pretty much spot on.  I had...</td>\n",

Saturday we tried again, we were 40th in line in my estimation, but got in because they hold the booths for larger groups (we were six) which worked in our favor. The waitress was wonderful, we added 2 more people 15 minute in, walking into Ippudo without a wait must be the greatest feeling ever, after we got the OK from the waitress. We ordered the pork buns and shishito peppers. The pork buns were slightly different from Momofuku, not with as much fat, topped with mayo and a sweeter sauce. Still very good, but I preferred Momofuku. Shishito peppers are always good, no need to comment. I got a special ramen, roasted miso base which you can add chili oil to or not. Only good until the end of February apparently.  My broth was amazing, very homey and not too heavy. Adding the oil makes it very heavy, which my friend didnt enjoy and instead ended up drinking my soup.  It comes with the usual, a little pork, bamboo shoots and half cooked egg. T...</td>\n",

My co-eater said after eating the Akamaru, \"I could eat 3 slices of pizza\" - I groaned because after eating the Karaka i was super full. Was definitely not crazy about the slices of pork in either dish and opted out of eating those.

You can choose any ramen with a side rice dish. They also give you a side salad. I had the Akamaru Modern and the eel rice dish. So yummy! I was very satisfied and full afterward. I cannot wait to go back there again.</td>\n",

Second Rule of Ippudo NY - Try to keep your beverage consumption to a minimum (every time I leave, I feel like I'm 10 months pregnant) Third Rule of Ippudo NY - If you don't want to wait over an hour for the best ramen and pork buns in NYC (sorry David Chang), then come at lunch time.   Every time I come here, it is an absolute pork fest.  When you are ushered into the dining room, you are greeted by the entire staff in unison.  Its great when you can go somewhere and order without even looking at the menu.  Here is what you should order when you go: - Samurai Ribs - Hirata Buns - Akamaru Modern Ramen with the following extras: Kakuni (pork belly) and Nitamago (soft boiled egg) Just take a deep breath, enjoy, and remember to limit your beverage consumption so you have enough room for their amazing broth.

Everything was delicious. Also, I could see how people would get mad about the wait.  The place isn't as big as I thought it would be, but the turnover rate is pretty good.  The servers are good being attentive to the customers and when they leave to clean up for the next ones.

I was slightly disappointed that there were only 2 slices of pork belly on top, so it's probably best to supplement with their suggestion of adding kakuni.

We came in before the rush (before 7pm) and took advantage of the 2 for1 beer special. Nothing like two ice cold asian beers for $6. When the last person in my party arrived we were greeted by some enthusiastic Japanese chants as we entered the dining area. If that couldn't make you happy to be there then nothing can. We ordered some sake and I love how they pour it in the traditional Japanese custom- may your cup over flow. We skipped the appetizers because as I've heard from fellow yelpers that you can't take anything home with you. I ordered the Karaka Kogashi Miso Ramen which I think is my new favorite soup ever. Spicy, salty, tangy plus noodles and pork belly... HOW COULD YOU GO WRONG? My dates chose the specialty ramen of which I took a taste of and it was delicious as well. I repeat, I love this place. I finished my whole bowl. That is all.</td>\n",

This was my last ditch attempt to find great ramen in NYC, and I was cautiously optimistic given the 2,200+ reviews. But ultimately, Ippudo was just OK. That's right. Just OK. The atmosphere is definitely fun and it's always a kick hearing \"Irasshaimase!\" echoed 50 million times when people enter the restaurant, so I'll give them points for that. I was also excited that they serve tonkotsu style ramen (cloudy broth made from pork bones). I had the Spicy Miso Tonkotsu. While it was a tasty bowl of soup, it didn't have enough porky flavor and the cabbage topping was also throwing me off.

The best IMO is Daikokuya in LA (not just because I'm from there). This place has a nice, kind of romantic ambiance.  There are a selection of soup bases to choose from, but we opted for the original one.  My friend got this spicy one, I don't remember the name, but it was way too oily for my taste. Overall, it was good, but NOT 2 hour wait good and not better than Daikokuya.  I wouldn't recommend this place for the ramen, but I would recommend it as a cool place to have dinner with friends and try the other dishes they have. *Sigh of relief* I don't have to fly back to NY to get ramen.  Saved $400 plane ticket back to NYC! Daikokuya still ranks supreme!</td>\n",

Chicken wings had great sause to it but had distinctive taset/smell often from being frozen for too long. And $7 for 3 wings, 3 pieces actually, not 3 wings was a bit expensive. For noodle, the soup base was pretty good, very thick and flavorful I am sure some ppl like it very much, it was just ok for me. My biggest complain is the noodle, I have had ramen in many places including Japan and other Asian localations, what they have at Ippudo was not top notch stuff.

It was no more than a 25 minute wait, which wasn't so bad but I didn't like the fact that I needed to share my table with a bunch of people I didn't want to see and frankly didn't want to watch while eating my food. I ordered  the Akamaru Modern with extra Kakuni becuase that's what everyone was raving about. The broth was really good but the ramen noodles were plain jane, just like any other ramen place. There are so little pork pieces which is why you need to order extra. The pork pieces are pretty fatty but they melt in your mouth like butter which is a plus. This place isn't that extraordinary but decent enough. Honestly I prefer to eat Santouka Ramen.</td>\n",

There are many great ramen places in California and Ippudo falls far behind them. What stands out in Ippudo are really the appetizers. Some favorites are the pork bun, chicken wings and the pork ribs. The raw octopus which looks really weird was also surprisingly excellent. The Akamaru Modern ramen, on the other hand, left much to be desired. Though the broth was tasty, the soft boiled egg was more hard than soft and the noodles they used was thin and not chewy enough. Another pet peeve is the wait time. If we had to wait 1.5hours for just two people, I would have expected the food to be amazing but it was just alright. I'd probably not come here often if I live in the city but it's still a must-go for the occasional NY trips for their tasty appetizers.</td>\n",

I had Akumara Modern and it had hands down the most flavorful broth I've ever tasted!  Pork was very tender, the soft boiled egg absorbed the flavors and complemented the soup beautifully. Pork rolls were great as an app. The only downside is I might go broke from multiple visits! -- it is on the pricy side but this is one case where you definitely get what you pay for.  Also they do kind of rush you along because it gets busy, though be sure you won't be waiting long for food!

If it's not too annoying, order Hirata buns (steamed pork buns) at the bar and have a drink while you wait OR I sometimes like to walk over to 3rd Avenue and 9th for some taro milk tea at Saint Alp's.  Either way, HIRATA BUNS ARE A MUST HAVE! I've tried all of Ippudo's different ramen combinations and I happen to love their Shiromaru Classic with extra pork, bamboo shoots and bakudan (a spicy paste that you can add into the broth).  This combination is juuuuust right.   Did I mention that you should really get the hirata buns?  I'm greedy so I order my own set of 2 instead of eating only one and sharing one.  ENJOY!</td>\n",

If you go after 6pm the wait can take up to 2 hours or sometimes maybe even more. They do not take reservations beforehand so definitely expect to wait. You can always get a few drinks at the bar while you wait. The bar and restaurant has a very cool ambiance. The bar is energetic and the drinks are very tasty. I really like Japanese ramen and I have to say this is one of the best I've tried. I like more citrus drinks. For drinks I recommend Shochu w/ Fresh Squeezed Grapefruit Juice or Yuzu Citrus Sake. It's both very refreshing but yet not too sweet and not too strong on the alcohol. EXCELLENT!</td>\n",

I thought that since I was there at 4PM, I'd be able to avoid the perpetual long line but I guess I just don't come here enough to know their hours. The menu is very limited but their noodles are quite good. This is definitely one of my favorite places for ramen. I always order more noodles because there's never enough! I always want more!

I'm not a big fan of Hakata style noodles to begin with, but Ippudo really just over cooked my bowl of noodles to soft textureless starch. The soup was warm (not exactly what I imagined after waiting for so long in the middle of winter), the broth itself wasn't as nearly as rich as most places. Overall, this place just really didn't live up to its name. If you are ever in Japan, try their 7-11 instant ramen cups, I actually prefer it over the actual store in New York.</td>\n",

The bar outside was PACKED with people waiting to be seated. Even some sitting on the floor. I assume they came in a big group so you know that's a big NO-NO during peak hours. I was seated at the bar and I knew what I had to get--the Akuramaru Modern and fish buns. The ramen was definitely worth all the hype.

The broth had a really nice pork flavor, the scallions were so fresh and the pork belly was perfect. The egg gave it a really creamy finish, which was nice.  And usually, the noodles are my least favorite part of ramen (kinda strange, I know), but these noodles were fantastic.  I ate until I literally could not fit anything else in my stomach.

Quite comical, but adds to the environment of the restaurant. I loved the ambiance  It was the complete ultimate UMAMI experience. I ordered the Akamaru Modern with kakuni  (braised pork belly). The pork belly was just the right blend and texture of meat and fat and had great flavor. Another time I went with a large party and we all felt like we had umami overdose aka MSG poisoning.

Definitely not something we expected. I think it's also ridiculous that the ramen was $15 a bowl. This place is not worth the wait. We waited 30mins for a table of 4 people and it's suppose to be not that bad of a wait. I also didn't appreciate being rushed out of the restaurant especially because I waited for so long. We weren't even done with our meal and they kept on taking it away after telling them that we weren't done. I feel like if I'm paying $12 for a rib I should be able to use all the sauce and savor the flavor. This was just something that I thought was annoying.</td>\n",

The dining room successfully incorporates traditional patterns with modern flare. I love the ramen bowl-lined wall behind a glass-covered ramen counter bar. Separable tandem seats around the communal table we sat at were also a nice touch. It's also nice to have a lively atmosphere with shouts of Japanese greetings welcoming new patrons every few minutes. On top of that, the service was great; the food came out fast, and they accommodated our big luggage that traveled with us. The ramen here was as good as advertised. I got the Akamaru Modern and I can now say that I have had the best ramen in my life. Compared to the ramen from Santouka, the broth from Ippudo is perfect.

Then the Japanese style barbecue ribs came out. I didn't think something could top the previous dish, but this did. Literally falling off the bone. Succulent. Juicy. Tender. Melt-In-Your-Mouth. Fall-In-Love-At-First-Bite. Eating Partner deemed this as his #1 of the whole weekend. When our ramen came, I was already full, but I could not stop myself from finishing my entire bowl once it was placed in front of me.

The Pork buns was amazing, the meat was not too fatty and very flavorful..too bad I can't say the same about the Bakuretsu Tofu..it was nothing special at all. Onto the main course. We got the Karaka Miso Ramen w/ poached egg. When the ramen bowl came out, the first thing I noticed about it was the small portion. It had like 3-4 pork slices and very little toppings.

Before I begin, I must add that I've been to Japan and of course, this does not compare to Japan and I don't think it's fair for reviewers to compare it to ramen country on the other side of the earth. Just my two cents. To start, my party and I had the pork buns, the chicken wings, and some special that, by now, I've completely forgotten what it is - except that it was bangin'. Pork buns were fatty and delicious. You can't go wrong with pork buns. Wings were my favorite as it was so flavorful, just the right amount of crispy on the outside yet amazingly tender on the inside - and it wasn't greasy! I could eat those everyday.

I usually eat at Terakawa Ramen at Lexington and their ramen is only $10 but definitely a lot tastier and flavorful. In my opinion, Ippudo is highly overrated and expensive just like its counterpart, Momofoku. The pork buns are really good but still too expensive for the size and quantity. To be objective though, the ambiance and service were both good. So if you are looking for a trendy, modern, good service, pricey restaurant with average tasting ramen and small but good appetizers, Ippudo is for you.</td>\n",

The broth was so yummy - savory and tasty.  The noodles were a bit thin for me. I like noodles with more of a bite.  The waitress also convinced me to get the pork buns which were very tasty, but not as good as what the reviews say. This place was swarming with people on a Monday night. A table for four would have been an hours and 15 minutes. Lucky (or unlucky for me) I was a party of one and sat at the bar.

I mean, living in Houston, we don't have Japanese Ramen.  For the fourth largest city in the nation, I'm surprised there isn't a single restaurant that offers it.  The most gourmet you're gonna get is throwing an egg in your bowl of ramen you whip up at home.   We hop out of our cab and start scoping around for Ippudo.  With no signage, more like a Japanese only signage, our eyes were darting around the block looking for it.  My gf asked a random guy off the street if he knew where it was.  Coincidentally, he wore an Ippudo shirt  \"I Heart Ramen\"!  He pointed us to the restaurant, and from that moment on, I have become enlightened to a whole new world of gourmet Ramen!!! Of course we run into a wait.  I didn't mine at the time, I was still full from dinner an hour earlier.  About 45minutes later we got seated.  We were greeted with a loud \"...</td>\n",

Pros: Friendly and good service, modern and fun environment, and delicious appetizers. We got the pork/chicken buns and a deep-fried lotus and shrimp special appetizer, which was definitely the best part about our meal and I highly recommend. Cons: Oolong iced teas were good, but not great and the amount served was only about 6 to 8 ounces (after the ice), and refills are not free, which was something that our server failed to mention. I got the Tori Ramen and was disappointed not only in the very salty broth and little amount of food, but the lack of ingredients that came with the noodles and soup.

The way they seat people is very inefficient. We waited for 1 hour and 30 minutes to 2 hours. We had a party of three and that took forever to seat because they wouldn't let you sit at a four-seater table if you had three people.

The broth was good not too sweet, and spicy is not spicy at all. The Buns where decent but not any better than any bao bun with good meat in it. The Pork didn't melt in your mouth like you would expect it to. Overall consensus I enjoyed my time there but the food isn't great and a bit overpriced.

The place can be a bit pricey, but let me remind you that you are paying for the ambiance and overall experience I guess.  A bowl of ramen here will run you $15 which I guess is pretty normal since a regular bowl in the bay area will cost you about $9-10 or so.   We had the Akamaru Modern and the Karaka Miso Ramen, which was was the spicy ramen and definitely my favorite!  Extra egg will cost you $2 and bamboo shoots $3.. but its soooo worth it!

Instead they give you a useless expected wait time, then occasionally walk around to see whose still around that is on the list, randomly calling names (yet the took your number to call you though they never call), and then after an hour or so when you check back in they act like your crazy for asking how much longer.

If you're really craving some tasty Japanese food, slip the hostess a twenty and see if they can save two hours of your evening.</td>\n",

It was packed, to say the least.  THEN when they called our names, we crawled through all the people and walked up, and they had given our table away.  It took us less than 15 seconds to get less than 10 feet, and they had ALREADY GIVEN AWAY OUR TABLE.   Food was okay, definitely not worth the price.

Yes, noodles were fresh and broth was good.

That being said, the ramen was awesome. I had the akamaru modern ramen. The broth was the key. It had this creamy garlicky taste that makes it unique. The noodles itself were on par. The pork chasu was great. Nice portion, tasty, fatty...mmmm! I also had the pork bun and I agree with the other reviews that they are pretty fantastic too. They treat their pork well there! I've been to both totto and ippudo. Totally different places. The atmosphere in ippudo is more upscale and trendy. It was 15 bucks for the ramen which is dang expensive for a bowl of noodles. I would go back again, but it's not somewhere I would be going to every week. So my rating is solely based on the food. If I took account the ...</td>\n",

Scoffed at us actually. We were bummed because we walked a few miles in the rain to get here. It was still raining so we decided to have a beer at the small beer/sake bar in the front. While we were drinking our beers, the lead hostess came over and asked if we wanted a table because she would squeeze us in. Nice! We had the Samarai Ribs, sweet, sticky, spicy. Shiromaru Hakata ramen which was awesome. The broth was rich and savory with a nice porkiness. The noodles were light and had a great texture to it.

The decor is very nice too - no matter where you're seated, there's always something to converse about. Staff: The staff are very into it, everyone speaks some Japanese - whether it's to greet a customer, place an order, or thank a guest. They're always on the move though, so it might be difficult to ask questions or get their attention.

I am sad that I've only eaten here once ever because it is just so delicious. It was quite a while to wait but it is the BEST ramen you will ever eat in your life. The ambience of the place is very trendy, hip and young. It's very intimate and probably a good place to take a date. Everything that was made was made in house. From the pork buns to the ramen noodles. Everything was a sensory experience. The pork buns that we ordered were amazing! The way it was prepared was very innovated. But the star of the meal was of course the ramen. I cannot gush enough about how much I loved the ramen. The broth had so much flavor, the pork was just tender enough to not be chewy, the noodles tasted freshly made. I have never had ramen that tasty before and whenever I visit NYC I will ALWAYS be making a stop there every time!</td>\n",

I know places in the U.S. have replicated it, but this place didn't do it for me. And while their pork buns (Hirata buns- $9) were pretty good, I have to admit that David Chang does this much better. Also, every good ramen should come with an egg (nitamago, which is boiled in a seasoned broth, or hanjuku tamago, a slow-cooked runny egg). This place makes you pay $2 in addition to the already overpriced $15 bowl. $17 for ramen is laughable. The bottom line is, everything was pretty good, but I wouldn't come back unless someone reeeally wanted to take me there. I hate to be a ramen snob, but if you're ever in Tokyo, you have to try Nagi Ramen in Shibuya. It's also about 800 yen ($10), which is the most you should ever have to pay for ramen.</td>\n",

I ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic ramen.  I wish I had the slightly thicker noodles my bf had.  He ordered the vegetarian ramen.  However, sometimes I feel when there's so many flavors in the ramen, it can be distracting.  Sometimes simplicity is best especially since we're eating ramen. My friend ordered the ramen with the clear chicken broth and I felt that was extremely flavorful.  For a \"light\" meal, I would definitely recommend that.

BANGING... lol  The appetizers are good, and some of my friends love them, but I'm all about the RAMEN BABY.  if you must get an appetizer, get the chicken wings, and the pork buns, those seem to be the favorites when we go out. Only down side I would say would be that if you try to eat during prime time hours, you going to wait a long time. So go either during lunch hours, or really late during dinner hours.  You can also try to get there 1/2 an hour before dinner starts, that worked for me once lol.  Another negative would be the feeling of paying $20 bucks for ramen is pretty crazy, but you gotta try it at least once, because its SO GOOD.  I visit this place every 2 months or so.

The noodle is different than the traditional ramen noodles.  This is thinner and tastes lighter than the other ramen place which is my favorite part of the dish.  Typical ramen noodle is egg noodles which is yellow, but this place has white noodles and straight.   The rest was just average.  I've had better meat and soup in other places for half the price.

It's not like any ippudo in japan and really does the name a disservice. Loud music booms in a hazy, dark, club-like environment filled wall to wall with an impatient and overly lubricated crowd. Don't expect to have a conversation or even be able to hear your name when it finally is called. Waited 45 minutes and was done eating in 20 minutes.   It's not a ramen-ya. There is ramen on the menu, but it's more a generic japanese restaurant with assorted food options. The tonkatsu ramen does not even approach the quality of ippudo's ramen in japan. It doesn't taste the same and just isn't good enough to merit any sort of wait. The tiny amount of noodles included with the standard ramen bowl weren't cooked enough and they charge extra for egg and other toppings that are included at their branches in japan. Ippudo is a chain and there should be some sort of consi...</td>\n",

Some people complained abt the noodles thickness, remember, it is ramen, not udon/soba. I love the thin noodles. If you love spicy, you can add Bakudan topping. The service is good, the servers are fast but friendly. They always check up on you &amp; fill up your glass w water. I love the atmosphere &amp; trendy decor.

When asked, gesture wildly; -Wander off to St. Mark's place (kenka if you're feeling lucky, je'bon if you're not) and drink something authentically Japanese (read: no sake slushes! Okay, you can have a sake slush at je'bon if you're not feeling particularly ethnic or chaste); -Come back two hours later and tell them you've been waiting outside the whole time. This is a little dishonest and morally reprehensible, HOWEVER if you are even a bit Machievellian and like pork broth you can probably write this off as a minor sin; -If it's your first trip, try the Akamaru Modern -- if not, go wild;...</td>\n",

Its big and modern inside. Super friendly staff! Gotta get the pork buns. Those are by far my fave. The pork is really tender and melt in ur mouth great! I also love the fried peppers with yuzu salt, its so simple but yet so good. All the ramen is great. Can't really go wrong. Staff is very tentative about clearing plates and keeping the table clean (which is a big plus for me...a clean table makes for happy eaters) fun vibe with and open kitchen. Did I mention the space. Not like the average NYC restaurant where and party of more than 4 is impossible to be sat...this place is big and comfortable.

We had switched restaurants so we didn't have any reservations.  We decided we were too hungry to wait so we went to another restaurant nearby.   Well, after we finished eating at the other restaurant, we decided to grab a second dinner!  Yes, immediately after our first dinner!  Needless to say, we felt like we were going to explode afterwards.   With that in mind, we still thought it was worth it to stop by.  We of course had the pork buns, which were delicious as always.  The slightly sweet and soft white bun with the perfect combination of lettuce and mouthwatering pork!  Their broth for their ramen has an incredible depth of flavor.

I had the special Wasabi Ramen Soup....it was incredible...My wife had the Miso one and she loved it as well. I do have a couple of small negative things to say...for one the waiter was nice but a bit pushy.  When we ordered two Ramen soups because my daughter is only 8 and would share one with me or my wife, he kept insisting that we order one for her as well.  Now these are big portions and there is no way a small child could finish the whole thing.  This bothered me a little. Now from reading some of the other reviews...I ordered the pork steak in ginger sausce.  I ofcourse asked the waiter what he thought and ofcourse I got the usual answer that it was his favorite..( for once I wish I could get an honest answer from a waiter...but will keep trying...LOL ). I must say I will never order that dish again...the pork had no taste and very fatty. We also ordere...</td>\n",

You can tell it's good because you'll be waiting 2 hours just to eat here. Yes it gets very very crowded! So expect to wait. Find a nearby bar to sit it out while you're waiting for your name to be called 2 hours later. Here's a tip: you can put your name down for the dinner list if you come during the day. You'll be thanking me later. Come during lunch as well. Not much of a wait so you'll be seated faster and you're just that much closer to ordering your Akamaru Modern. I come here strictly for their ramen, but their pork buns are really good too. It's a tie between here and David Chang. Both are equally good to me.</td>\n",

But in a city like this, there are so many other places you can go without having to wait 2 hours for a table for ramen of equal or greater quality. The only thing here that's worth that wait - the pork buns.

During lunch they had this \"lunch box\" type option where we were able to order a ramen with a side order, i.e. unagi don or fried chicken over rice. I guess I should've started off by stating that I am not fond of ramen ... or any soup for that matter.  But because of all the hype I thought I should just give it a shot -- and needless to say I was quite impressed. The ramen was very tasty and, much to my surprise, I ate till I was actually full.  Being that I am an extremely picky person, I would rather starve than eat something I don't like =X.  However, I must admit that I did enjoy my \"side order\" of unagi don more.

The Ramen dish arrived with one of each of the tasty bits promised on the menu, but noodles themselves were plentiful and pretty good. I've had better noodles though at Hung Ry, Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles, or Terakawa. I didn't really taste any wasabi, so I added some of my friend's spicy paste. I needed a kick... The bean curd was particularly disappointing since it was just a piece of inari. The Grilled Eel in the lunch set was very tender and quite a highlight, and the rice was very sweet and starchy, like Japanese rice should be.

The one that really stood out to me was the special with the wasabi broth; the wasabi flavor added a kick.

Thankfully I remembered because the Ippudo special unique blend of salty parmesan and strong miso made my bowl of ramen real exciting to eat! They couldn't make the soup shovels any bigger to enjoy your bowl of soup. And with an extra $3, I made myself a lunch special adding a small salad and spicy fried chicken over a bowl of rice. Ippudo is not serving you 10 for $1 ramen. Don't forget the Hirata Pork buns--they are spicy, sweet, salty, soft, and gone within minutes of being served. The space is clean and contemporary with a huge shape of a tree made of bamboo stalks by the kitchen. When the host brings in new gues...</td>\n",

The ramen is expensive ($14-17) but delicious.  I had the Akamaru Modern - a giant bowl of mild but richly flavorful broth with roast pork and a heap of miso paste.  The pork must have been roast pork belly - it was so tender, succulent, and rich, without being too fatty.  Yum. I also love the GIANT spoons that come with the ramen - they were about 3 inches in diameter, had a hook at the end of the spoon to prevent the ramen from sliding into the bowl, and your spoon came with its very own spoonrest.   The pork buns were very good, but not as good as Momofuku's.  The pork belly was deliciously tender, but I missed the sweet hoison and pickled cucumber, and I could swear the buns were less soft and delicate. That said, still delicious.   I'd have a tough time deciding whether this place's ramen beats Momofuku's - they're both top notch!</td>\n",

A Right when you walk into the restaurant, you can tell this place is very trendy. I ordered the Akamaru Modern with all of the toppings. This was very delightful and the soup was as delicious it gets. I've tried as many ramen places in Houston and in New York and Ippudo is definitely on the upper echelon of ramen places in the US (...I want to go to Japan...) Being a trendy place the price is obviously a little on the higher side. Almost $20 for that bowl of ramen...but it was worth it on a cold rainy night in NYC.

There were special touches to the recipes and one gotta go to a specialty ramen shop even in Japan to have this type of flavors.   So was it worth a 15 min wait? Definitely.

The food is really good, one of the best ramens I've had in NYC. The place itself is pretty neatly decorated, too. But I took a star off because I honestly didn't think their ramens are worth 2 hours spent on the street. Also, if you're in need to get a bowl but don't want to wait, try around 2:30pm during a weekday. It's not so crowded.</td>\n",

Came in a bit skeptical, despite rave reviews from family and friends, but coming from California, we had tasted some of the best, including Daikokuya, Santouka, and Shin-sen-gumi.  We were first impressed with the beautiful decor but really, who cares about decor, its all about the ramen.  And it didnt disappoint.  Kevin got the Hakata Ramen Lunch Set C, which comes with a bowl of fried spicy chicken and a salad, while Shuinn got the Karaka Men.  Both were outstanding, and were happy to say that it was the BEST ramen either of us have ever had.  (except in Japan).  The finishing touch was a nice complimentary cup of green tea at the end of the meal to cleanse the palate and soak up the delicious ramen juices.  We look forward to coming back whenever we're in town.</td>\n",

The wait is ridiculous -- we got there at 1 and they said we wouldnt get a table till 3:30... so we made reservationsfor 6:30 (they don't take reservations over the phone -- just in person... pretty dumb rule). But that wasn't the issue.  Not at all, I'm used to waiting long hours for good food. We get there at 6 and they said our table would be ready later.  That's fine.  We chill at the bar and have some beers and order some pork buns. The pork buns... are amazing.  $9 for 2 of them, but it's well worth it.  The buns are so perfect and the pork inside is amazing.  The sauce is just godly.  The pork could be a bit more tender, but it's still great.  Cool.  Cool.  Good stuff... 6:30 comes by.  They estimate 6:50.  Okay.  That's fine. 6:50 comes by... they say not yet. 7:15 comes by... they finally come. Okay, 45 minutes after our reservation... not too bad.  At least the world famou...</td>\n",

The restaurant, designed for communal seating, only seats tables of 2 and 4 in a prompt and timely fashion. Any other seating arrangement you will be waiting for centuries. Even if a couple arrives way after you have, they will be in and out the door way before you are seated. We went knowing we had to wait, but after seeing couple after couple entering and exiting before we even got our chance i began questioning the hostesses method of wait times and seating. After kindly asking her why she was doing what she wAs doing, her rude , unprofessional and lack of consideration of customer service put ,e on the edge. To our experience even worse, we ended up with a greedy, selfish and inconsiderate waiter who believed that placing a bowl of noodles in front of you was fantastic service.

The noodle (thinner and finer than most ramen places) was fresh but I prefer the more traditional size and texture. The broth was good but it didnt knock my socks off. I think Dojo/Santa/Maru in the Bay area probably compare better on taste and depth of flavor. That said, I wasn't dying of thirst afterwards (no MSG?) We ordered appetizer of Samurai Rib, Bakuretsu Tofu and Hirata Bun. Of the three, I liked the Samurai Rib the most. Bakuretsu Tofu is cute. Like Korean jigae but a little out of place as it competes with the ramen if you plan to have ramen. The Hirata bun wasn't too special. Momofuku's pork buns are probably better (from what I recall). It gets stars for the vibe, decor, and service. Net net ... I dont think I would wait in line to pay $14 for ramen again.   \n",

It makes you feel so welcome when the servers all say something in Japanese when you walk into the main dining room, and then again when you leave. Must haves: pork buns and all of the ramen dishes are good, ask for their special spicy sauce to put in the ramen. YUM   \n",

Great atmosphere and very friendly employees.  I was really impressed with how great the place looked and how well the servers were treating everyone, including myself. I was told 15 minute wait so I walked outside because of the crowd inside and not even 2 minutes later someone came out and called my name, guess I got lucky. I had just before that got donuts from the Doughnut Plant and had my bag, the girl said that they dont allow outside food but courteously told me I can bring it in just dont show it off. All the service was very quick and I never had an empty cup. This place is just on par with daikakuya in L.A. but better because for the ambiance and courteous/speedy service. As far as straight ramen is concern it's still no match for Santouka.  It's a bit pricey, because ramen shouldn't ever be more than $10 but hey, its New York right?   \n",
              "2011-01-09  Joining a league of thousands...I am adding my review to the sea of others to add to the hype that is Ippudo. We arrived early (for brunch standards) and only had to wait about 15-20 mns and even had some bench space.  We did have to share our table (communal) but that's ok.  It's large/wide enough to accomodate several parties at once.  The only thing is you end up next to those with you and not across from them.  So unless you're going w. a large group, be ready to share space. *Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri (Japanese cucumber mixed with sesami oil dressing): this we got from seeing a high recommendation on a friend's yelp.  Wow.  This was amazingly good and wondrously addicting.  I mean how do they keep the cucumber so crisp?  How is the sauce so light yet packs such flavor?  How do I recreate this delicious and yet so simple dish??  After we finished I wished we had ordered 2 or 3.  Next time... *Hirata Buns (Steamed buns filled w. pork and served w.

              "2011-01-09  You come here to say you did. Food: Pork buns were scrumptious, as were the deep fried oysters. Akamaru Modern --mild broth/noodles cooked superbly. I am not a fan of very fatty meat though, which the pork was...though I knew what I was getting into: (pork belly!) Karaka Kogashi Miso Ramen was extremely rich and difficult to eat. We enjoyed our meals, but later that night I felt extremely sick/nauseous. Wait: On a Sunday night we waited in line for 20 minutes just to put our name on the list. Be prepared to wait three hours for a table, so plan a walk for aperatif somewhere else and come back to check in. The tiny bar was only accommodating around 8pm, otherwise packed. Between 3:30-4:30 and you won't have to wait long. Service: Hostesses were patient, kind, and calm with all the chaos going on around them. Bartender was attentive and replaced my friend's drink when it didn't appeal to her. I expected the dining service to be superb because of the popularity of the restaurant, howe...   \n",

Good place, although the wait times for a table are ridiculous. It has a nice, club-like feel to it without the loudness associated with a club. The food is great. We started with the most popular appetizer, the pork buns. Good stuff. The pork had sirachi and a bit of a kick, but it wasn't overwhelming, which was appreciated. I had the \"Classic\" and while I thought the meat was a little tough, the ramen was tasty enough to make up for it. It snowed outside while we waited for a table. The snow was so bad that it felt like I was being poked and prodded by a bunch of icy needles whenever it hit unprotected skin. As a result, we had to take a cab home.   \n",
              "2011-01-12  This place is an ABSOLUTE-MUST if you're visiting NYC!!! My friends and I were SUPER EXCITED about NYC because we had heard so many fantastic reviews about this restaurant. A word of advice: this place gets crowded quickly, and you will need to place reservations. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon, and the cashier told us we would have an 1.5 hour wait, but we were eased when they said they would give us a call 20 minutes before our table was ready. What to do from there? Take a trip to SoHo and get some shopping done! Sure enough, we did receive a call and by the time we came back to Ippudo, our table was ready. From the moment you enter in the actual dining area to the moment you leave, it's quite the experience. It's a traditional Japanese ramen house, so naturally you are greeting by the waiters when your party enters the room (they announce it to the entire room).

The noodles came out fast, no wait time although we did eat at an odd hour for lunch.   Many reviews state the long wait times to eat, but since I've yet to experience that, all I can say is the food must be good if you are willing to wait.  The ramen, from the broth to noodles, GREAT!  I ordered the Karaka Ramen, spicy, which tasted very similar to a korean spicy beef broth soup.       Price: For $40 (including tip) for 2 people its not too bad considering the quality of the food.   I can definitely see myself going back on a cold day for a bowl of hot ramen soup!   \n",
              "2011-01-17  I was doubtful. I've had $1 ramen you buy in supermarkets and you heat up in your microwave and comes with the little packets of seasoning/grease/salt. I've had $9 ramen that was good, but kind of salty and in the end I still felt like I was eating ramen. $14 ramen? How good could it be? Without even tasting the ramen, I was already impressed by the ramen  bowl that was size of my face. It came with a equally large soup spoon to match. The key to great ramen is the soup. So I tentatively took a small sip. The flavors just exploded in my mouth! It was savory with just right amount of salt. The pork was moist and also perfectly seasoned. All my previous doubts were washed away with each additional bite of the perfectly chewy noodles and soup. If you are waiting, you can get a head start on your meal by getting drinks and appetizers at the bar. We had the edamame that was served with a side of citrus salt. The salt was delicious was probably the best part. I like the chic decor, but t...   \n",

The ramen was good, but not that outstanding. I ordered a green tea creme brulee, it was phenomenal. They put a lot of matcha in it... yummy!

I was thinking this place better be good.  Well lucky for The Gap, they got my after Christmas money while I was waiting for my table. Fast forward - place is medium size, not giant and not the super small place that traditional ramen places used to be. Their lunch meal deal is GREAT.  It comes with salad, rice with your choice of topping, I recommend the eel.  YUM!  Giant bowl of ramen.  Delicious.  We also ordered the pork buns, but I'm not a fan of mayo in my pork buns. I would definitely recommend!   \n",

I can tell you straight off the back that the service is great, but the waiting time just to get in is just ridiculous. I've been here probably about 3 times but I always order the karaka ramen, that's preferably the best thing on the menu. I've tried others such as modern and such and such from tasting it from my friends plate.     I'd have to say the ramen is here is not great, but not bad, but your probably be getting the same kind of ramen if you were to go to Santoka in Mitsuwa.  Also their appetizers are great such as the tako wasabi probably the best and freshest i had in NY. Their pork buns are good too, but the only thing is that these appetizers are way overpriced. I usually go with 2 people with appetizers, ramen and drinks usually comes up to over 100. That's pretty expensive in my opinion. I thought ramen was suppose to cheap.   \n",

I had never had ramen until I went there, and every ramen bowl I've eaten since does not compare. The steamed pork buns are amazing!!! The line is usually insane, but i usually give them my cell number after putting my name in for a table, then i walk to the irish pub on the corner to get away from the crowd. It works like a charm.   \n",

The issue was the line...  it was just too long during the meal time (lunch or dinner) and just not worth the wait.   I actually waited for them to open (I thought around 11 am or 11:30 am) and be the first ones to get in.   It was still a wait with other people had the same idea - but it was much better than the first time.   I stopped going because it was just not worth my time...   I will definitely go back when I  figure out another way to get in without a long wait.   \n",

I go here all the time with my girlfriend and we are willing to wait the hour it takes to get a seat. It's a bit pricier than the other ramen joints but it's well worth it. The only ramen I have had that is better than this place is in Tokyo, so that says a lot.   \n",

But I was pleased when we finally got seated...next to a couple of strangers, which was not too bad because they kept to themselves. The constant yelling or \"greeting\" of the waiters were welcoming at first, but also kind of intimidating. But yeah. The wait for the famous ramen was ridiculous. It took so long for the noodles to be served, but totally worth the wait. But it took a while waiting for the bill too.   \n",

I was disappointed because mine came default with thin ramen noodles - no bueno. Make sure when you order you get the thicker ramen noodle, it is not indicated on the menu! Also, the pork buns were good but not up to par compared to the ones from Momofuku. 3.5 stars, but rounding to 4 because our server was super nice!!   \n",

As a ramen novice, I can't give you a dissertation on the differences between noodle, broth types, etc. etc. - all I can say is that it's just plain good eats. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who hasn't tried restaurant ramen before!   \n",

              "2011-02-03  My brother and five of our friends went here and had to wait two hours to get a seat. However, let me say that it's worth it. The ramen here is incredible. I had the Akamaru Modern and it was delicious, especially with the pork belly. The fact that they allowed a refill on ramen was even better. I definitely was full by the end of the night. The wait was worth it. The environment here is very cozy and warm especially after the cold winter that we waited outside in. The dark ambiance was very attractive and the fact that we got to see the cooks do their thing, it was nice. I liked the walls that had the hiragana. It was a nice touch and it's made of foam. They're actually the names of the people who had a hand in either making Ippudo a reality or their financiers. I don't remember, but it was a very nice touch. I also liked the paper paintings located between the tables in the back and the bar. I recommend coming here at least one time. This is the best ramen I have ever tasted so f...   \n",
              "2011-02-06  Rich, creamy, and VERY satisfying tonkatsu ramen. I happen to be a huge fan of tonkatsu broth...that buttery porky deliciousness is so satisfying.  And this place does it *well.* First things first, the wait is out of control, but I knew that so we put our name in and went for a walk.  I called about 35 minutes later to check in and they let me know it was just about time to head back.  We went back and were seated within 5 minutes. I love the decor, and the way they use the chairs with arms on one side to partition off the pairs of diners around the big table in the middle. I ordered the shisito peppers as a starter, and really enjoyed them with the yuzu salt for dipping.  I did feel they were a little oilier than versions I've had at other places, probably because they are fried rather than grilled.  I think I prefer grilled, as you get that blackened outer skin that is very satisfying. My companion had the tonkatsu classic, which was very, very good.  Pretty much spot on.  I had...   \n",

The pork buns are DELICIOUS but the ramen trumps all. I still dream of that meal, even the soft-boiled egg in the ramen was perfect. I would skip the dessert next time, but just because I would want to fill my stomach with pork belly and steaming broth. I totally wish there were something similar in Chicago!   \n",

Total came out to $50 between 2 people for a beer and 2 ramen which is a little excessive in my opinion.  I'm not going to lie, the food was good...really good but I don't think it's worth $16.  Egg noodles are egg noodles and their soup base is definitely very unique.  4 stars still because the waitresses were very cute, food is very good, and atmosphere was very comfortable.

              "2011-02-14  Ive tried three time to get into Ippudo. Saturday we tried again, we were 40th in line in my estimation, but got in because they hold the booths for larger groups (we were six) which worked in our favor. The waitress was wonderful, we added 2 more people 15 minute in, walking into Ippudo without a wait must be the greatest feeling ever, after we got the OK from the waitress. We ordered the pork buns and shishito peppers. The pork buns were slightly different from Momofuku, not with as much fat, topped with mayo and a sweeter sauce. Still very good, but I preferred Momofuku. Shishito peppers are always good, no need to comment. I got a special ramen, roasted miso base which you can add chili oil to or not. Only good until the end of February apparently.  My broth was amazing, very homey and not too heavy. Adding the oil makes it very heavy, which my friend didnt enjoy and instead ended up drinking my soup.  It comes with the usual, a little pork, bamboo shoots and half cooked egg. T...   \n",

Waited for 35 minutes at the bar, until we got seated. You can also order food at the bar along with a nice selection of sake and imported beers. Had Kogashi Miso Ramen which beyond delicious. The place had a great vibe, with nice looking and attractive crow. Will def be back.   \n",

We went there for a Valentines day dinner expecting it to be amazing (after all it has over 2000 reviews and still 4 stars on yelp, who has that??) and although it wasn't terrible it was just underwhelming. The hostess was incredibly disinterested. The food seemed to be an 'American' take on Japanese food, all the tempura was very heavy and the flavours couldn't be said to be precisely balanced. To be fair we ordered a series of appetizers and didn't try the Ramen which seems to be what this place is lauded for, however after my boyfriend almost regurgitate his oyster, we left feeling less than satisfied.   \n",

If you'd really like to try this place, I'd suggest going early when they first open at 11am. The lines aren't as long and you get better service. When walking in, don't get startled by them screaming welcome to you. The ramen was alright, but I'm comparing that to the Ippudo in Japan, which is by far way better. The one thing they had the upper hand on was their Hirata buns. Chicken and pork were both really, really good. you definitely have to get those while your there. you'll regret it if you don't.   \n",
              "2011-02-19  Liked the Karaka Kogashi Miso Ramen way more than the Akamaru Modern Ramen. People on Yelp loved the Akamaru, which was why we ordered them, however the noodles were not nearly as substantial as in the Karaka - and the flavors were not as bold or spicy. The Karaka noodles were chewy and plentiful, in a rich spicy broth - however a little on the greasy side. My co-eater said after eating the Akamaru, \"I could eat 3 slices of pizza\" - I groaned because after eating the Karaka i was super full. Was definitely not crazy about the slices of pork in either dish and opted out of eating those. We also got the pork buns - which yes, were good BUT not what we were expecting - they were served with lettuce and mayo so it was like we had a mini pork sandwich before eating our ramen. I wouldn't necessarily order them again. I gave Ippudo 2 stars mostly because my partner was disappointed with the Akamaru, I didn't love the lettuce/mayo combo on the pork bun and while the Karaka were a solid dis...   \n",

We waited about half an hour so it wasn't that bad. As soon as you walk in you'll see the wall filled with hanging empty noodle bowls! The place was awesome! As the hostess walks you into the dining room you are quickly greeted in japanese which was pretty cool. My gf are i ordered the Hirata buns and the samurai ribs for appetizer! YUMMM! A MUST when eating here! As fas as the noodles we ordered the Akamaru Modern and Shiromaru Hakata Classic and both we're delish!! So good that we both ordered extra noodles! =) And I liked it so much that my gf got me an I LOVE Ramen shirt! Definitely going back to Ippudo!   \n",

I have nothing bad about to say about Ippudo... my advice is try to go early at the lunch rush to avoid waiting; however, waiting anything under 40 minutes is completely and totally worth it. By far my favorite lunch spot... I would go there for dinner too except I'd still be too full with all the delicious ramen in my belly.   \n",

Yes- the wait is horrendous. Go as a single . . . better chance of getting in more quickly. You won't talk to your dining companions anyway, after you tuck into this divine bowl of ramen.

I don't know how they cooked it but the pork skin is crisp and the meat itself is so soft and tender. We decided to go with the lunch set. You can choose any ramen with a side rice dish. They also give you a side salad. I had the Akamaru Modern and the eel rice dish. So yummy! I was very satisfied and full afterward. I cannot wait to go back there again.   \n",
              "2011-02-22  First Rule of Ippudo NY - Do not eat anything within five hours of going (trust me). Second Rule of Ippudo NY - Try to keep your beverage consumption to a minimum (every time I leave, I feel like I'm 10 months pregnant) Third Rule of Ippudo NY - If you don't want to wait over an hour for the best ramen and pork buns in NYC (sorry David Chang), then come at lunch time.   Every time I come here, it is an absolute pork fest.  When you are ushered into the dining room, you are greeted by the entire staff in unison.  Its great when you can go somewhere and order without even looking at the menu.  Here is what you should order when you go: - Samurai Ribs - Hirata Buns - Akamaru Modern Ramen with the following extras: Kakuni (pork belly) and Nitamago (soft boiled egg) Just take a deep breath, enjoy, and remember to limit your beverage consumption so you have enough room for their amazing broth.  If you still have space, you can order more noodles by banging your fist as hard as you can on...   \n",

This place is good.  I just got the regular ramen because I feel that the first time at a place you should try their signature dishes.  I also got the pork buns too because everyone says to try the pork buns.  Everything was delicious. Also, I could see how people would get mad about the wait.  The place isn't as big as I thought it would be, but the turnover rate is pretty good.  The servers are good being attentive to the customers and when they leave to clean up for the next ones. For those thinking the wait isn't too long: I was there 15 minutes before it opened and I was one of the last people to have a spot in the restaurant.  For those who came WHEN it opened had to wait.   \n",

              "2011-02-27  Really enjoyed dinner here!  Interior is dark and earthy, with hewn wood table tops.  Don't be suprised if you are seated at a communal table for smaller parties. Their pork buns are the best I've had.  I truly enjoyed the contrasts in flavor and texture.  The shisito peppers were also great as a starter. I got the Akamaru Modern ramen.  It was very satisfying, and the broth was delicious.  I was slightly disappointed that there were only 2 slices of pork belly on top, so it's probably best to supplement with their suggestion of adding kakuni.  I also felt that the dish was lacking a little punch of contrasting flavor - after eating a whole bowl of this, my palate felt a little bored. My friend got the Karaka Kogashi Miso Ramen (I think), and I enjoyed this as well.  His broth was a little oily, but it had huge depth of flavor, along with a nice spicy punch. Service was friendly and efficient, but don't expect to linger over dinner.  After they brought the bill and we paid, they ga...   \n",

We came in before the rush (before 7pm) and took advantage of the 2 for1 beer special. Nothing like two ice cold asian beers for $6. When the last person in my party arrived we were greeted by some enthusiastic Japanese chants as we entered the dining area. If that couldn't make you happy to be there then nothing can. We ordered some sake and I love how they pour it in the traditional Japanese custom- may your cup over flow. We skipped the appetizers because as I've heard from fellow yelpers that you can't take anything home with you. I ordered the Karaka Kogashi Miso Ramen which I think is my new favorite soup ever. Spicy, salty, tangy plus noodles and pork belly... HOW COULD YOU GO WRONG? My dates chose the specialty ramen of which I took a taste of and it was delicious as well. I repeat, I love this place. I finished my whole bowl. That is all.   \n",

              "2011-03-08  When it comes to Japanese food, I'm old school. I don't like dairy or neon-colored sauce on my sushi and I dislike fancified $14 bowls of ramen when a well-made, traditional version can taste like heaven on its own. This was my last ditch attempt to find great ramen in NYC, and I was cautiously optimistic given the 2,200+ reviews. But ultimately, Ippudo was just OK. That's right. Just OK. The atmosphere is definitely fun and it's always a kick hearing \"Irasshaimase!\" echoed 50 million times when people enter the restaurant, so I'll give them points for that. I was also excited that they serve tonkotsu style ramen (cloudy broth made from pork bones). I had the Spicy Miso Tonkotsu. While it was a tasty bowl of soup, it didn't have enough porky flavor and the cabbage topping was also throwing me off. Hard to place my finger on exactly what wasn't right, but it just didn't satisfy my ramen craving. Husband got the special Kumamoto Tonkotsu Ramen, which basically seemed to be the same a...   \n",

Enjoy a delicious bowl of noodles here!   \n",

The small box of braised pork belly you can order with your soup is one of the best things you will ever put in your mouth. Next time I come I might skip the soup and order 4 boxes of pork..... glutenous? I thought the soup was very good but I couldn't help but feeling that the broth needed an extra something (I'm thinking an acid). The pork buns were of course very good but I could do without what I'm pretty sure is McDonald's special sauce they put on them. Best plan is to show up 10 minutes before 5pm so you skip the giant line.   \n",

The best IMO is Daikokuya in LA (not just because I'm from there). This place has a nice, kind of romantic ambiance.  There are a selection of soup bases to choose from, but we opted for the original one.  My friend got this spicy one, I don't remember the name, but it was way too oily for my taste. Overall, it was good, but NOT 2 hour wait good and not better than Daikokuya.  I wouldn't recommend this place for the ramen, but I would recommend it as a cool place to have dinner with friends and try the other dishes they have. *Sigh of relief* I don't have to fly back to NY to get ramen.  Saved $400 plane ticket back to NYC! Daikokuya still ranks supreme!   \n",

It's not bad, just not good enough. Chicken wings had great sause to it but had distinctive taset/smell often from being frozen for too long. And $7 for 3 wings, 3 pieces actually, not 3 wings was a bit expensive. For noodle, the soup base was pretty good, very thick and flavorful I am sure some ppl like it very much, it was just ok for me. My biggest complain is the noodle, I have had ramen in many places including Japan and other Asian localations, what they have at Ippudo was not top notch stuff. It lacks the cheweness should come with ramen. The place around the corner on St Mark's suits my taste better.   \n",

All the waiters and waitresses were extremely welcoming and everyone greets you when you're seated. It was no more than a 25 minute wait, which wasn't so bad but I didn't like the fact that I needed to share my table with a bunch of people I didn't want to see and frankly didn't want to watch while eating my food. I ordered  the Akamaru Modern with extra Kakuni becuase that's what everyone was raving about. The broth was really good but the ramen noodles were plain jane, just like any other ramen place. There are so little pork pieces which is why you need to order extra. The pork pieces are pretty fatty but they melt in your mouth like butter which is a plus. This place isn't that extraordinary but decent enough. Honestly I prefer to eat Santouka Ramen.   \n",

I have never missed going Ippudo every time I'm in New York but it's really not for the ramen. There are many great ramen places in California and Ippudo falls far behind them. What stands out in Ippudo are really the appetizers. Some favorites are the pork bun, chicken wings and the pork ribs. The raw octopus which looks really weird was also surprisingly excellent. The Akamaru Modern ramen, on the other hand, left much to be desired. Though the broth was tasty, the soft boiled egg was more hard than soft and the noodles they used was thin and not chewy enough. Another pet peeve is the wait time. If we had to wait 1.5hours for just two people, I would have expected the food to be amazing but it was just alright. I'd probably not come here often if I live in the city but it's still a must-go for the occasional NY trips for their tasty appetizers.   \n",

Thank goodness they did because I think I've found my new favorite restaurant in New York.  I was craving Japanese noodle soup and this place does not disappoint.  I had Akumara Modern and it had hands down the most flavorful broth I've ever tasted!  Pork was very tender, the soft boiled egg absorbed the flavors and complemented the soup beautifully. Pork rolls were great as an app. The only downside is I might go broke from multiple visits! -- it is on the pricy side but this is one case where you definitely get what you pay for.  Also they do kind of rush you along because it gets busy, though be sure you won't be waiting long for food! Ramen as we know it (ie the 10 cent variety) and Ippudo do NOT belong in the same sentence!  :)   \n",

I enjoyed the special Ramen they had tonight better.  I think the special changes every time you go...so the name is useless. Shoyu Ramen contains a very salty broth.

If it's not too annoying, order Hirata buns (steamed pork buns) at the bar and have a drink while you wait OR I sometimes like to walk over to 3rd Avenue and 9th for some taro milk tea at Saint Alp's.  Either way, HIRATA BUNS ARE A MUST HAVE! I've tried all of Ippudo's different ramen combinations and I happen to love their Shiromaru Classic with extra pork, bamboo shoots and bakudan (a spicy paste that you can add into the broth).  This combination is juuuuust right.   Did I mention that you should really get the hirata buns?  I'm greedy so I order my own set of 2 instead of eating only one and sharing one.  ENJOY!   \n",

DELICIOUS RAMEN!  I got the Shiromaru Hakata Classic. It's definitely worth experiencing. I went around 5:30pm and waited about 15 minutes on a weekday. If you go after 6pm the wait can take up to 2 hours or sometimes maybe even more. They do not take reservations beforehand so definitely expect to wait. You can always get a few drinks at the bar while you wait. The bar and restaurant has a very cool ambiance. The bar is energetic and the drinks are very tasty. I really like Japanese ramen and I have to say this is one of the best I've tried. I like more citrus drinks. For drinks I recommend Shochu w/ Fresh Squeezed Grapefruit Juice or Yuzu Citrus Sake. It's both very refreshing but yet not too sweet and not too strong on the alcohol. EXCELLENT!   \n",

I thought that since I was there at 4PM, I'd be able to avoid the perpetual long line but I guess I just don't come here enough to know their hours. The menu is very limited but their noodles are quite good. This is definitely one of my favorite places for ramen. I always order more noodles because there's never enough! I always want more!

I'm not a big fan of Hakata style noodles to begin with, but Ippudo really just over cooked my bowl of noodles to soft textureless starch. The soup was warm (not exactly what I imagined after waiting for so long in the middle of winter), the broth itself wasn't as nearly as rich as most places. Overall, this place just really didn't live up to its name. If you are ever in Japan, try their 7-11 instant ramen cups, I actually prefer it over the actual store in New York.   \n",

              "2011-04-11  I would like to believe that I am quite the ramen connoisseur. I've tried almost every ramen establishment with high ratings in SoCal and I've created a mental ramen ranking and compare new bowls of ramen to my esteemed list. Therefore, I had to give Ippudo a try during my last trip to NYC. Even if that meant that I would have to walk 2 miles in the cold after shopping and enjoy dinner by myself. Luckily, because I was the only one in my party I got seated almost right away at the bar. I heard other parties of 2+ having a wait time of 2 hours or more. Yikes! The bar outside was PACKED with people waiting to be seated. Even some sitting on the floor. I assume they came in a big group so you know that's a big NO-NO during peak hours. I was seated at the bar and I knew what I had to get--the Akuramaru Modern and fish buns. The ramen was definitely worth all the hype. I loved the broth so much and it was very different from the ramens I've had back at home. The black sauce made the sou...   \n",

              "2011-04-12  I've been hearing about Ippudo for a long time and figured it was time to make the trip.  I went on a Monday at about 7 and the wait was about 15 minutes.  Not bad.   I ordered the pork buns and the Akamaru Modern.  The pork buns were diviine.  They had excellent flavor and the bun itself (not sure what that's called) was so soft, it basically just melts in your mouth.  I could've eaten about 10 of them, but unfortunately it only comes with 2. The Akamaru Modern was phenomenal.  I ordered it with the recommneded toppings- the pork belly and egg.  The broth had a really nice pork flavor, the scallions were so fresh and the pork belly was perfect. The egg gave it a really creamy finish, which was nice.  And usually, the noodles are my least favorite part of ramen (kinda strange, I know), but these noodles were fantastic.  I ate until I literally could not fit anything else in my stomach.  I was still full in the morning. I am docking one star because it's probably the most expensive ...   \n",

I was greeted with random but happy shouts of Japanese from the wait and kitchen staff, and you can't help but shout at least something back. Quite comical, but adds to the environment of the restaurant. I loved the ambiance  It was the complete ultimate UMAMI experience. I ordered the Akamaru Modern with kakuni  (braised pork belly). The pork belly was just the right blend and texture of meat and fat and had great flavor. Another time I went with a large party and we all felt like we had umami overdose aka MSG poisoning. Literally everyone in our group of 10 felt like passing out afterwards, and boy was everyone cranky. Many people had vowed not to return after that incident, but I still held on to a glimmer of hope... I returned a 3rd time and had an experience similar to the first, so I had regained my favor in Ippudo. O...   \n",

I think it's also ridiculous that the ramen was $15 a bowl. This place is not worth the wait. We waited 30mins for a table of 4 people and it's suppose to be not that bad of a wait. I also didn't appreciate being rushed out of the restaurant especially because I waited for so long. We weren't even done with our meal and they kept on taking it away after telling them that we weren't done. I feel like if I'm paying $12 for a rib I should be able to use all the sauce and savor the flavor. This was just something that I thought was annoying.   \n",
              "2011-04-16  Ippudo is infamous for having long lines going out their door, so we took no chance at arriving early. Our punctual arrival was rewarded with being the first customers seated. The restaurant's design and décor is visually pleasing both externally and internally. The dining room successfully incorporates traditional patterns with modern flare. I love the ramen bowl-lined wall behind a glass-covered ramen counter bar. Separable tandem seats around the communal table we sat at were also a nice touch. It's also nice to have a lively atmosphere with shouts of Japanese greetings welcoming new patrons every few minutes. On top of that, the service was great; the food came out fast, and they accommodated our big luggage that traveled with us. The ramen here was as good as advertised.

Then the Japanese style barbecue ribs came out. I didn't think something could top the previous dish, but this did. Literally falling off the bone. Succulent. Juicy. Tender. Melt-In-Your-Mouth. Fall-In-Love-At-First-Bite. Eating Partner deemed this as his #1 of the whole weekend. When our ramen came, I was already full, but I could not stop myself from finishing my entire bowl once it was placed in front of me. I ordered the special, which I thought was the best of the three ramens we had ordered.

I was told by the bartender that this was, \"the best ramen you'll find in the U.S.\" While I appreciate his enthusiasm, this guy must not have eaten much ramen in the U.S.  I've had better in both LA and SF (and Japan). The ramen wasn't terrible. However, the broth lacked the complexity of taste that I'm used to. Also, the pork belly was a little dry.  Yes, that's right, dry pork belly.  How is that even possible?

              "2011-04-21  First Impression: The very first thing that you will notice going in Ippudo is the length of the waiting line (yes, sometimes it may go OUT THE DOOR), and it's very difficult to say \"Yes I will wait\" to the hostesses IF it is your first time. Experiences: But I have to give you the heads up that their ramens are DANGEROUSLY GOOD! I've gotten a Akamaru Modern the first time I've been there, and the 'First Bite' brought me to heaven (still craving it now). Make sure the way you eat includes a spoonful of broth because that's what make the ramen extraordinarily full of taste. The ramen strands are perfectly made; not stretchy, not soggy, not too soft, but just right. The TOFU appetizer was simply delicious with the soup/broth which it came along with.

We started with 3 appetizers (Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri, Pork Buns, and Bakuretsu Tofu). The Yamitsuki looked simple but was very tasty and refreshing. The Pork buns was amazing, the meat was not too fatty and very flavorful..too bad I can't say the same about the Bakuretsu Tofu..it was nothing special at all. Onto the main course. We got the Karaka Miso Ramen w/ poached egg. When the ramen bowl came out, the first thing I noticed about it was the small portion. It had like 3-4 pork slices and very little toppings.

Although I would like to take a star off for the wait, all the other factors of the restaurant were perfect and I just can't find it in my heart to do that to my beloved Ippudo. Before I begin, I must add that I've been to Japan and of course, this does not compare to Japan and I don't think it's fair for reviewers to compare it to ramen country on the other side of the earth. Just my two cents. To start, my party and I had the pork buns, the chicken wings, and some special that, by now, I've completely forgotten what it is - except that it was bangin'. Pork buns were fatty and delicious. You can't go wrong with pork buns. Wings were my favorite as it was so flavorful, just the right amount of crispy on the outside yet amazingly tender on the inside - and it wasn't greasy! I could eat those everyday. I ordered the Akamaru ramen with bamboo shoots, poached egg, and the chili paste. Everything was perfect...   \n",

I usually eat at Terakawa Ramen at Lexington and their ramen is only $10 but definitely a lot tastier and flavorful. In my opinion, Ippudo is highly overrated and expensive just like its counterpart, Momofoku. The pork buns are really good but still too expensive for the size and quantity. To be objective though, the ambiance and service were both good. So if you are looking for a trendy, modern, good service, pricey restaurant with average tasting ramen and small but good appetizers, Ippudo is for you.   \n",

I recommend adding the soft boiled egg and roasted pork belly topping for a greater depth of flavor and variety. For appetizers, get the Japanese peppers and the pork buns. The peppers are slightly spicy, but the seasoning salt and the lemon that come with it both help to cut the heat. The pork buns are roasted pork wrapped in Chinese style bread with a bit of lettuce and wasabi dressing. Don't tell my grandmother, but Ippudo's are better than hers. Ssshh. Everything is delicious here and the 2.5 hour wait may just be worth it. No reservations, but as they say, \"Good things comes to those who wait.\"   \n",

The ambiance, costumers, and employees were lively, and chatter filled the room. This place is known for its noodles, and if that's what you are coming here for, you won't be disappointed (at least not too much). The noodles were good, but they were certainly not the best (the reason it's not 5 stars, and the service which I will get to), but overall, it was a good experience. There is a small bar there too, but I don't like where it's situated. The service was okay, but not great. Okay, I was trying to sugarcoat it, the service was terrible. Our waitress barely paid any attention to us. In fact, she didn't even stop by after we got our food to ask us how our food was, and if there was anything else that we needed. Now I know, she probably was busy,...   \n",

And we love it every time. Granted the wait is outrageous - but this never seems to deter us. We have a system - place our names in the queue then head over to a coffee shop, movie or pool hall to kill time. It always works out. I've brought family over when they were visiting and we've successfully converted them to the religion that is Ippudo noodles. The Hirata buns are pure organismic goodness. I switched over to pescetarianism about 5 months ago and I was overjoyed when a couple of times I went there and they had the Hirata fish buns. This is definitely our go-to place when we want some bomb-ass noodles. The wait is minor compared to the amazing food that awaits you.   \n",

Minus one star because I didn't like the noodles that much. I ordered the Akamaru Modern (The original \"Tonkotsu\" noodle soup topped with Ippudo's secret \"Umami Dama\" miso paste, pork chashu, cabage, kikurage, scallions, and fragrant garlic oil). The broth was so yummy - savory and tasty.  The noodles were a bit thin for me. I like noodles with more of a bite.  The waitress also convinced me to get the pork buns which were very tasty, but not as good as what the reviews say. This place was swarming with people on a Monday night. A table for four would have been an hours and 15 minutes. Lucky (or unlucky for me) I was a party of one and sat at the bar.  Zero minute wait. :) Glad I tried it - definitely recommended... but maybe not worth the wait.   \n",

The ambiance and food was great. I had the akamaru modern ramen, which was really yummy. I got it with the pork loin instead of the pork belly. I'd probably get the pork belly with it instead next time. I had the pork bun appetizer which was really tasty. Not the best pork belly I've had but pretty close to it. TIP: if you go after 10pm there is almost little to no wait time at all! FYI: Kitchen closes at 11:30pm.   \n",

              "2011-05-12  With only a few nights left in NYC, and after a full meal, we decide to try out Ippudo.  I had to see for myself what all this Ramen is about.  I mean, living in Houston, we don't have Japanese Ramen.  For the fourth largest city in the nation, I'm surprised there isn't a single restaurant that offers it.  The most gourmet you're gonna get is throwing an egg in your bowl of ramen you whip up at home.   We hop out of our cab and start scoping around for Ippudo.  With no signage, more like a Japanese only signage, our eyes were darting around the block looking for it.  My gf asked a random guy off the street if he knew where it was.  Coincidentally, he wore an Ippudo shirt  \"I Heart Ramen\"!  He pointed us to the restaurant, and from that moment on, I have become enlightened to a whole new world of gourmet Ramen!!! Of course we run into a wait.  I didn't mine at the time, I was still full from dinner an hour earlier.  About 45minutes later we got seated.  We were greeted with a loud \"...   \n",

              "2011-05-14  After waiting over an hour and shelling out over $70 for two people for a couple appetizers, two iced teas, and two sub-par ramen bowls (tip not included), I can confidently say that this place is completely overrated by Yelp users and it should not deserve a 4 to 5 star rating. Pros: Friendly and good service, modern and fun environment, and delicious appetizers. We got the pork/chicken buns and a deep-fried lotus and shrimp special appetizer, which was definitely the best part about our meal and I highly recommend. Cons: Oolong iced teas were good, but not great and the amount served was only about 6 to 8 ounces (after the ice), and refills are not free, which was something that our server failed to mention. I got the Tori Ramen and was disappointed not only in the very salty broth and little amount of food, but the lack of ingredients that came with the noodles and soup. My girlfriend got the Wasabi Shoyu Ramen, which was not only very salty, but very sweet, and eating the tofu ...   \n",

As for the actual dining experience, the staff was very nice and courteous. They were very knowledgeable of the food and made excellent recommendations. I ordered the tori ramen, and it was good overall, but not the stellar dish of ramen I was expecting for such a crowded place-and for the price!

The soup is delicious, but there are only two measly thin pieces of meat for toppings unless you pay for more. The noodles are scrumptious and you can get extra refills of them. You probably can only have two extra servings of noodles though because they require you to have enough soup to hold the noodles. The way they seat people is very inefficient. We waited for 1 hour and 30 minutes to 2 hours. We had a party of three and that took forever to seat because they wouldn't let you sit at a four-seater table if you had three people. You had to wait until exactly only three seats were available, which took FOREVER. Also, the hostess was giving special seating treatment to some of her friends that came in to eat there.   \n",

The decor and atmosphere is very nice, and loungey. I had the: Akamaru ramen ( $17) with a poached egg ($2)   Hirata Buns (2 pieces)    $9 The ramen noodles where chewy and tasted like chinese or vietnamese fresh thin egg noodles that you can get at many noodle places. The broth was good not too sweet, and spicy is not spicy at all. The Buns where decent but not any better than any bao bun with good meat in it. The Pork didn't melt in your mouth like you would expect it to. Overall consensus I enjoyed my time there but the food isn't great and a bit overpriced.

              "2011-05-31  Who woulda known there'd be a hipster ramen spot in the heart of NYC? Just kidding.. although it is pretty hip for what it is.  Nice, dark interior... the servers are also easy on the eyes.  Good thing we came here on an off day.. even on Weds night we had about a 30 minute wait for 3.  The place can be a bit pricey, but let me remind you that you are paying for the ambiance and overall experience I guess.  A bowl of ramen here will run you $15 which I guess is pretty normal since a regular bowl in the bay area will cost you about $9-10 or so.   We had the Akamaru Modern and the Karaka Miso Ramen, which was was the spicy ramen and definitely my favorite!  Extra egg will cost you $2 and bamboo shoots $3.. but its soooo worth it!  And of course we had to get an order of the steamed pork buns.... OMG SO GOOD! I almost wanted an order to go to bring back home.. but I probably would've eaten it all to myself.  We also had an order of the duck over eggplant which I thought was really goo...   \n",
              "2011-06-03  If I was just rating the service staff and the food I would give five stars, but since I'm rating the whole experience its 1.  The front door people are so ridiculous it blows my mind.  I've been ~15x in the past 2 years and the each time the hostesses get worse and worse.  There's always a wait but when someone tells you you're crazy for wiling 2+hours and then is rude when you that's fine it incomprehensible.  For one its really not that hard to estimate the wait when you know how many tables there are, the average time per table, AND they take your number to supposedly call you when it's getting close.  Instead they give you a useless expected wait time, then occasionally walk around to see whose still around that is on the list, randomly calling names (yet the took your number to call you though they never call), and then after an hour or so when you check back in they act like your crazy for asking how much longer.  It's GREAT that they have a restaurant with the best ramen in...   \n",

The food is good, the space is cool, but I know a ton of places where I can get the same quality for less and not wait half the evening. The service is punctual and friendly once you get seated and the ramen is delicious.  If you're really craving some tasty Japanese food, slip the hostess a twenty and see if they can save two hours of your evening.   \n",

Do NOT go here, you might as well throw your money into a blender.  They don't take reservations, but my friend and I were tired from the day we had, so we decided to sit there for the HOUR AND A HALF wait (and by sit, I mean on the window sill, since they only have maybe 5 seats in the waiting area).   It was packed, to say the least.  THEN when they called our names, we crawled through all the people and walked up, and they had given our table away.  It took us less than 15 seconds to get less than 10 feet, and they had ALREADY GIVEN AWAY OUR TABLE.   Food was okay, definitely not worth the price.  I was still hungry after 2 appetizers and a bowl of ramen.   The waiters/waitresses are nice, but the hostesses should go back to the corner they were picked up from.   \n",

Caveats: I've never been to Japan. I've eaten a lot of different ramen in San Francisco but only Ippudo in NY. I'm a big fan of noodles and soup in general. Now that that's out of the way, ahem. Best. Ramen. Ever. Get the classic or the modern and only branch out if you come often. I recently visited NYC for the weekend and thought I'd branch out with the wasabi. It was wonderful but I had a sip of the modern broth my man was slurping and I got totally jealous. The tofu tartare app is also quite stunning, btw.   \n",

Maybe I'm spoiled because we get really good ramen in CA (both NorCal and SoCal), so I only thought this place was just 'A-OK' ...   \n",

We went on the reccomendation of Claire Robinson after her review on FoodTVs 'The Best Thing I Ever Ate'. And she was right. Simply an amazing Ramen soup! and in such a huge bowl! And the steamed rolls, YUMMY! We had the shrimp ones and it was so tasty and the shrimp was coated in great sauce. My boyfriend tried the pork ones as well but said the shrimp ones were tastier. The whole experience was quite enjoyable, from the loud japanese yells coming from the kitchen to greet customers to the waitress who was nice enough to take a few pictures for us. If your in New York City, DEFINITELY check this place out!   \n",

You have your entire group together because they don't let you add on to an open table. They claim it's their older order system that doesn't allow it. So we had to split a birthday party because 2 people were late. The hostesses were not accomedating at all. The food and service is excellent in all fairness but pads on this place unless your group is ready to go.   \n",

I always expect that going here, but the ramen is always worth the wait. This last time though- a Tuesday night around 10pm- the service was really really rushed.  Granted, at that point, the place wasn't full- which always makes me question why I still had to wait an hour for a table- but the waitress and all the busboys kept trying to take my plate away before I was finished. I waited long enough to get in, at least let me take that same time to eat. Didn't do ramen this time, but should have. It is still the best on the menu.   \n",

Wow... I was ready to skimp, but my husband was dying to try it out. Time seemed to pass by really fast... but as I looked at my clock, the hostess was pretty accurate. I think we sat after about an hour and 10min? We saw Anne Burrell there so this place must be pretty good. An hour and a half wait and $15 for a bowl of ramen. Was it worth it? I think not My husband loved it though. Yes, noodles were fresh and broth was good. Maybe if we came at slow hours ... and maybe if I was craving ramen THAT bad, I would come back... but I dont think I ever crave ramen THAT bad to pay $15 for it.

              "2011-07-03  I have mixed feeling about ippudo. First of all ramen is supposed to be a low budget, quick eating type of food. My Japanese friends would be shocked to hear that I went out for ramen for dinner and even more so that I waited over an hour to eat it. But I love ramen so I had to eat here. That being said, the ramen was awesome. I had the akamaru modern ramen. The broth was the key. It had this creamy garlicky taste that makes it unique. The noodles itself were on par. The pork chasu was great. Nice portion, tasty, fatty...mmmm! I also had the pork bun and I agree with the other reviews that they are pretty fantastic too. They treat their pork well there! I've been to both totto and ippudo. Totally different places. The atmosphere in ippudo is more upscale and trendy. It was 15 bucks for the ramen which is dang expensive for a bowl of noodles. I would go back again, but it's not somewhere I would be going to every week. So my rating is solely based on the food. If I took account the ...   \n",

The soup base for the ramen was very rich and aromatic. I would have liked more toppings in the noodles (you can add extra for an additional charge but we didn't think it would be necessary). A bit noisy (staff would randomly shout out cheers behind your back so make sure you don't have any heart conditions) and most tables are shared (which is actually an authentic and realistic depiction of Japanese ramen shops) so probably not the best place to have serious dinner conversations. The wait was okay--it was rainy and we got there around 7 on Friday--we were told it would be an hour to an hour and 20 minutes but we only sat at the bar for about half an hour before getting seated.   \n",

We showed up at Ippudo at 9:30pm on a Sunday. It was packed! The hostess brushed us off when we asked for a table for two. Scoffed at us actually. We were bummed because we walked a few miles in the rain to get here. It was still raining so we decided to have a beer at the small beer/sake bar in the front. While we were drinking our beers, the lead hostess came over and asked if we wanted a table because she would squeeze us in. Nice! We had the Samarai Ribs, sweet, sticky, spicy. Shiromaru Hakata ramen which was awesome. The broth was rich and savory with a nice porkiness. The noodles were light and had a great texture to it. This is a good reason to make the trek out to Ippudo, walking in the rain, deal with a rude hostess...all worth it.   \n",

The apps are good.  Wifey and I had the Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri (simple cucumber sliced with sesame oil, chili flakes and salt), Tako Wasabi (raw baby octopus in a chopped wasabi paste), pork buns, and at that time a Philly Cheesesteak Egg Roll.  Pork buns are pork buns, but the rest were awesome.  Wifey especially loved the Philly egg roll. The ramen is good.  The times we've been there, wifey's had the Miso ramen, the Karaka miso ramen and the Akamaru ramen.  I've had the Classic, Akamaru and a special Monkfish Shio ramen.  The one time we brought our girls, they enjoyed the ramen, too.   However, there's a reason people keeping getting pulled into the ramen.  It's called Ajinomoto.  You taste it and you're drinking tons of water after because of it.  But that's the way it is.   \n",

Ippudo I am a big fan of the classic ramen and karaka men ramen. It can be a little bit pricey, but it is definitely worth it. I went there at around 2:00 PM, and waited for around 30 minutes to get seated. The pork buns were also tender and juicy!   \n",
              "2011-07-21  Food: I've tried the Akamaru Modern, Classic, Miso, Spicy Miso Ramen, and stuffed mushrooms (not on menu anymore). The soup base is very flavorful, and I always go for the additional items (pork and eggs). With everything added in, it brings it to ~20 per bowl, but you get complimentary ramen if you have enough soup. It's well worth the splurge (wait time + money). Atmosphere: Very hip and lively. The bar at the front is for people who want to wait while having a few drinks. The wait usually runs from half an hour to two hours depending on the day. The decor is very nice too - no matter where you're seated, there's always something to converse about. Staff: The staff are very into it, everyone speaks some Japanese - whether it's to greet a customer, place an order, or thank a guest. They're always on the move though, so it might be difficult to ask questions or get their attention. Final Thoughts: I haven't found a better ramen shop, and I try to make it my goal to eat here at leas...   \n",

(stick with the momofuko pork buns - ambrosia).  ippudo has a rep of long waits.  however,  i've never waited more than 20 minutes in peak hours.  like i wrote, just go.   \n",

I am sad that I've only eaten here once ever because it is just so delicious. It was quite a while to wait but it is the BEST ramen you will ever eat in your life. The ambience of the place is very trendy, hip and young. It's very intimate and probably a good place to take a date. Everything that was made was made in house. From the pork buns to the ramen noodles. Everything was a sensory experience. The pork buns that we ordered were amazing! The way it was prepared was very innovated. But the star of the meal was of course the ramen. I cannot gush enough about how much I loved the ramen. The broth had so much flavor, the pork was just tender enough to not be chewy, the noodles tasted freshly made. I have never had ramen that tasty before and whenever I visit NYC I will ALWAYS be making a stop there every time!   \n",

I thought I sat down to eat Japanese food, but at the same time I tasted Chinese. The noodles are on the harder side. The Pork Buns were delicious! However at first glance I saw the white buns usually used to serve Peking Duck. I got really excited, confused and scared. I did not know how to feel. Where was my loyalty! I really like the atmosphere of this restaurant.   \n",

Make sure you come an hour or so early to put down your name as this place gets very busy! Meanwhile you can hang out at the crowded bar or take a walk to kill time, but it's definitely worth the wait!   \n",

I thoroughly enjoyed Akamaru Modern as well as the Shiromaru Hakata Classic.  The noodle itself is okay, but where Ippudo excels is the broth/soup.  It is simply fantastic.  Rich, hearty, just the right blend of flavor and consistency, not too thick, not too liquid, it is as well made as ramen broth can possibly be made.  Price is reasonable albeit a little pricey compared to the other ramen establishments, the staff is fantastic, and the atmosphere is a bit loud but quite inviting.  The wait can be a bit long.   \n",

I sure hope there are better because it's not nearly as flavorful as the delicious bowls you find in Japan. I know places in the U.S. have replicated it, but this place didn't do it for me. And while their pork buns (Hirata buns- $9) were pretty good, I have to admit that David Chang does this much better. Also, every good ramen should come with an egg (nitamago, which is boiled in a seasoned broth, or hanjuku tamago, a slow-cooked runny egg). This place makes you pay $2 in addition to the already overpriced $15 bowl. $17 for ramen is laughable. The bottom line is, everything was pretty good, but I wouldn't come back unless someone reeeally wanted to take me there. I hate to be a ramen snob, but if you're ever in Tokyo, you have to try Nagi Ramen in Shibuya. It's also about 800 yen ($10), which is the most you should ever have to pay for ramen.   \n",

It's very good but the wait is 1hr (on a slow day)!  Normally, I wouldn't consider wait time in my reviews but it was just too ridiculous, esp for an expensive ramen place.   The broth is very complex and flavorful.  I ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic ramen.  I wish I had the slightly thicker noodles my bf had.  He ordered the vegetarian ramen.  However, sometimes I feel when there's so many flavors in the ramen, it can be distracting.  Sometimes simplicity is best especially since we're eating ramen. My friend ordered the ramen with the clear chicken broth and I felt that was extremely flavorful.  For a \"light\" meal, I would definitely recommend that. Next time, I probably would go try a different ramen place.  But, I would recommend the Classic or the one with the chicken broth.   \n",

There is a wait if you come during peak hours and the wait can be as long as two hours. However, if you come alone, sometimes they can sneak you in with a very little wait. The pork buns are amazing and they have really good pork belly. The akamaru modern is so good and I usually get some extras like egg and pork belly with it.   \n",

The broths are just so flavorful and complex. you can tell they take time and effort to make it.  My favorite is Akamaru Modern, then the Miso Ramen.  Add an egg in there, some kakuni as well... BANGING... lol  The appetizers are good, and some of my friends love them, but I'm all about the RAMEN BABY.  if you must get an appetizer, get the chicken wings, and the pork buns, those seem to be the favorites when we go out. Only down side I would say would be that if you try to eat during prime time hours, you going to wait a long time. So go either during lunch hours, or really late during dinner hours.  You can also try to get there 1/2 an hour before dinner starts, that worked for me once lol.  Another negative would be the feeling of paying $20 bucks for ramen is pretty crazy, but you gotta try it at least once, because its SO GOOD.  I visit this place every 2 months or so. TRUST... its good money.   \n",

But it's well worth it, if only to taste the delicious pork buns (~$4 a piece but quite small), which I believe you can order by the bar while you wait. They were the best pork buns I've ever had. The ramen is good and flavorful but is it worth waiting in line for 2 hours and paying ~$15 per dish? Maybe not but I'd go back any day for those buns!   \n",
              "2011-08-18  Be prepared for a very long wait: 1.5hrs for me.  I had enough time to walk to another restaurant, eat and then be back for this hyped up ramen joint.  The atmosphere was great.  I walked in and it feels like I'm in a club with the upbeat music and cool décor.  This place I heard is known for its ramen bowls.  I ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic: the original \"Tonkotsu\" noodle soup topped with pork loin chashu, kikurage, menma, red pickled ginger, sesame, and scallions.  The noodle is different than the traditional ramen noodles.  This is thinner and tastes lighter than the other ramen place which is my favorite part of the dish.  Typical ramen noodle is egg noodles which is yellow, but this place has white noodles and straight.   The rest was just average.  I've had better meat and soup in other places for half the price. Overall, I think this place is overpriced for just ramen, but the desserts are creative and great.    It's just not the place for ramen for me.  But I would c...   \n",
              "2011-08-19  Avoided this place for years because just felt it would be bad. Instincts were right. This place is hateful on so many levels. It's not like any ippudo in japan and really does the name a disservice. Loud music booms in a hazy, dark, club-like environment filled wall to wall with an impatient and overly lubricated crowd. Don't expect to have a conversation or even be able to hear your name when it finally is called. Waited 45 minutes and was done eating in 20 minutes.   It's not a ramen-ya. There is ramen on the menu, but it's more a generic japanese restaurant with assorted food options. The tonkatsu ramen does not even approach the quality of ippudo's ramen in japan. It doesn't taste the same and just isn't good enough to merit any sort of wait. The tiny amount of noodles included with the standard ramen bowl weren't cooked enough and they charge extra for egg and other toppings that are included at their branches in japan. Ippudo is a chain and there should be some sort of consi...   \n",

They specialize in Hakata ramen which is milkier, thicker, collagen'y broth -- not the more typical soy based ramen you're accustomed to.  I think they also have shoyu and shio (salt based) ramen broths too, but haven't tried.  I liked Setagaya's shio ramen, so will stick to having it there. Also, the other appetizers are grossly overpriced.  I think $9 for the cucumber? And as noted 100000 times, the wait is horrendous.  I try to go at off hours.  3pm lunch, etc...   \n",

Ippudo has delicious dessert options. My two favorites are lady m mille crepe cake and matcha brulee. As for ramen, for beginners it is best to try Akamaru Modern. Some people complained abt the noodles thickness, remember, it is ramen, not udon/soba. I love the thin noodles. If you love spicy, you can add Bakudan topping. The service is good, the servers are fast but friendly. They always check up on you & fill up your glass w water. I love the atmosphere & trendy decor. I'm not bothered by servers shouting Japanese words, because that what makes the place alive too. It's not boring like most restaurants.

              "2011-08-22  Finally after numerous attempts to visit Ippudo, I have succeeded.  I went to Ippudo on a Saturday as the first stop on my food crawl of East Village.  The bf and I arrived before it opened and there was already a line.  Good thing we were fifth in line!  I was excited.  Unfortunately, we were two out of our party of six and had to wait for the entire party before being seated.  We arrived at 10:30 am and were not seated until 12:00 pm, probably about 40 mins after our whole party arrived.  (Note for next time..pair off and eat in smaller groups).   The bartender was very nice and attentive to detail.  While we waited, we had a few drinks.  He stood there and picked the seeds out of the lemon garnishes as he was cutting them.  I love that! The decor is super cute at the booths.  We started off with the pork buns.  Yummm, the pork was tasty, a bit salty but the mayo balanced it off.  I wish the lettuce was shredded though and there was a bit more fat on the pork.  Not as soft and te...   \n",
              "2011-08-22  Obviously, if you're going to claim to love ramen in New York, you've got to have tried Ippudo. HOWEVER, a lot of enjoyment of Ippudo relies on how one goes about approaching the (nonexistent) reservation system. A few tips: -Show up at an off hour, preferably 2pm in the middle of the week (if you're employed, tough luck); -Put down your name and pretend that your entire party is waiting outside. When asked, gesture wildly; -Wander off to St. Mark's place (kenka if you're feeling lucky, je'bon if you're not) and drink something authentically Japanese (read: no sake slushes! Okay, you can have a sake slush at je'bon if you're not feeling particularly ethnic or chaste); -Come back two hours later and tell them you've been waiting outside the whole time. This is a little dishonest and morally reprehensible, HOWEVER if you are even a bit Machievellian and like pork broth you can probably write this off as a minor sin; -If it's your first trip, try the Akamaru Modern -- if not, go wild;...   \n",

In particular the pork buns are amazing. I'd advise against going their for dinner..there's for sure at least an hour wait. Went there during lunch one day and only had to wait 5 mins. That, to me, seems like a much better deal!   \n",
              "2011-08-27  Ippudo is like that decent looking girl that has a pretty great personality.  You're like kinda interested but she's making you wait because she's not sure... so you're like, girl, you're just not worth the damn wait. The primary reason you go to Ippudo is the ramen.  But honestly, the ramen is whatevers man.  The broth isn't smooth, the pork isn't juicy, the noodles are ok.  It's one of those things, that's solid on a cold day.  It's that, ehhhh sure feeling.  Let's do it. Here's the problem with that.  It's trendy and cute, great place to take a date.  You know what that means?  Like all things trendy in New York City, you're gonna get a beast like wait.  An hour minimum folks.  Is mediocre ramen really worth it? But remember how I said this girl has a great personality?  Well she does.  It might not be the main reason you go to Ippudo, but their appetizer, the FREAKIN PORK BUNS, holy crap.  They're ridiculously good.  If I could just buy a million of those, I would just bath in ...   \n",
              "2011-08-29  Konichiwa! The waiters, hostess, sushi chefs, and managers welcome each guests as they walk in....does it get to your head when you hear them great some other party? who cares....i'm too focus on the food to notice anything. We waited what felt like days outside in the dark in the the cold (it was around 45 degrees when I visited). We were the first to enter the intimate setting of Ippudo. I felt like a king. Good service and better food...something I thoroughly enjoy. The pork Hirata Buns are a must as an appetizer...and you'll need 2 for yourself, trust me. Soon after, order their ramen (either Shiromaru Hakata Classic or Akamaru Modern). Here's is the tricky party: eat fast and savor the taste....you'll need to let it cool for a bit since they come hot. Once it settles then go at it before it gets cold and the taste dies with it. Getting full? Not enough noodles? Ask for Kae-dama if you dare....an extra serving of noodles for the fearless. When you're bowl is empty, sit back, le...   \n",

At least they let you grab some Japanese beer at the bar while waiting. It's expensive, so what? It's the best freakin ramen in the States! I won't make this review long because there are so many reviews on this restaurant anyway. Akamaru Modern - MUST. GET. With an egg, of course. Tori Ramen - If you want something else. Very clean taste. Chicken broth tends to make me feel gross afterwards.. Not this one! Pork Buns - W...t....h.... WHY SO GOOD?!?! You must get this. I don't care how full you'll be from the ramen. This is a must. I have yet to try their desserts.. But this place is as close as New York will EVER get to a real Japanese ramen. And I will forever love this place.   \n",
              "2011-09-06  im sure im not going to say anything new but i thought id jot this down anyways.  we waited an hour for ramen.  then our bill was close to one hundred dollars.  all i gotta say is:  overhyped.  overrated!! dont get me wrong ive lived in hakata/kyushu where this tonkotsu/thin white ramen hails from.  it is pretty darn close to the real deal.  but i hate waiting so long for food!  and ramen is not supposed to be expensive! we put our name down and they said 1.5 hours.  ok so we hop on over to copper square hotel for drinks seeing as ippudo had no room for us to stand.  we call at the one hour mark and are told it will be another 1 to 2 hours!  what?!??!  so we stomp back in and tell them hello we are here.  they say 20-30 minutes.  wow  ok that was weird.  we wait at the bar.  i have a yuzu rock and bf had a beer. we were seated at the bar and we order a salad with tofu.  the waiter kept asking us if we had questions and we kept saying no we just wanted to order.  seems like everyone...   \n",

The pork buns, though far from traditional...was quite good and would probably go back just for those they have a ever so slight kick vaguely similar to korean spicy pork, and the sauce which i guess was kind of like an aioli almost was a big hit with some of the people on the table.   \n",
              "2011-09-12  Yes, hate me.  At 6:10 p.m. on a Wednesday night I waited 15 minutes and got seated for a party of two.  10 minutes after I checked in, the wait time for new signees was already up to 45-60 minute waits.  So go early on a weeknight... beat the after work dinner crowd! Pork Hirata Buns - 2 for $9.  Good, flavorful fatty pork with lettuce and some mayo.  A little pricey (heck, everything is a pricey here for the quantity you get). Hirata Chicken Wings - 3 for $7 (they made us 4 pieces for an additional charge).   Sweet black pepper sauce that made my tastebuds jump, fried to the perfect crispness, loved it.  But more than $2 per wing.  Worth trying, but Bon Chon is a much better deal.   Akamaru Modern - $15 with bamboo shoots (additional $3) with Kae Dama (extra noodles $2).  Tonkatsu soup with miso paste, pork, and garlic oil.  A very good ramen, but I can't say for certain it's the best I've ever had.  I would've probably been better off not ordering the additional noodles because ...   \n",

My friend and I ordered 2 ramen, 2 appetizers and a beer and it's around $70 total.  I can't say it's cheap for ramen but it's absolutely delicious, so it's worth the price.   \n",

And ask for the xtra noodles at the end~!!! soo good....   \n",

That place is way over rated, and over priced now. This is now my go to ramen house when I take ppl from out of town to eat. Its big and modern inside. Super friendly staff! Gotta get the pork buns. Those are by far my fave. The pork is really tender and melt in ur mouth great! I also love the fried peppers with yuzu salt, its so simple but yet so good. All the ramen is great. Can't really go wrong. Staff is very tentative about clearing plates and keeping the table clean (which is a big plus for me...a clean table makes for happy eaters) fun vibe with and open kitchen. Did I mention the space. Not like the average NYC restaurant where and party of more than 4 is impossible to be sat...this place is big and comfortable. So next time u feel like going to momo-fu walk a few block down and check out this spot...u might love it   \n",

My friends came from out of town and we came here for dinner, but they were packed and the wait time was at least 45 minutes.  We had switched restaurants so we didn't have any reservations.  We decided we were too hungry to wait so we went to another restaurant nearby.   Well, after we finished eating at the other restaurant, we decided to grab a second dinner!  Yes, immediately after our first dinner!  Needless to say, we felt like we were going to explode afterwards.   With that in mind, we still thought it was worth it to stop by.  We of course had the pork buns, which were delicious as always.  The slightly sweet and soft white bun with the perfect combination of lettuce and mouthwatering pork!  Their broth for their ramen has an incredible depth of flavor. The service has been good every time I came here.  I just love this place!   \n",
              "2011-09-26  Finally made it to this place and I will say that all the previous reviews are on the money as far as their Ramen Soups go. I had the special Wasabi Ramen Soup....it was incredible...My wife had the Miso one and she loved it as well. I do have a couple of small negative things to say...for one the waiter was nice but a bit pushy.  When we ordered two Ramen soups because my daughter is only 8 and would share one with me or my wife, he kept insisting that we order one for her as well.  Now these are big portions and there is no way a small child could finish the whole thing.  This bothered me a little. Now from reading some of the other reviews...I ordered the pork steak in ginger sausce.  I ofcourse asked the waiter what he thought and ofcourse I got the usual answer that it was his favorite..( for once I wish I could get an honest answer from a waiter...but will keep trying...LOL ). I must say I will never order that dish again...the pork had no taste and very fatty. We also ordere...   \n",

This place was pretty comparable really. Noodles were slightly over-done, but everything else was just right. Service was good and environment was fun. Expect to wait 90 mins or so. Put your name down then have them call you, then go for a drink nearby.   \n",

The broth is just soooo delicious that I can drink all of it and my bowl will be clean by the end of dinner. The pork buns are good too! I love the bread they use. So nice and fluffy! Lychee martini is killer here too. So don't be surprised if you're stumbling out of the restaurant because they make some strong drinks here. But delicious! Just be prepared to wait. It gets ridiculously crowded here. I mean like having to wait 2 hours just to eat kind of crowded!!   \n",

I can't imagine anyone being disappointed here.  Its great.   \n",

You can tell it's good because you'll be waiting 2 hours just to eat here. Yes it gets very very crowded! So expect to wait. Find a nearby bar to sit it out while you're waiting for your name to be called 2 hours later. Here's a tip: you can put your name down for the dinner list if you come during the day. You'll be thanking me later. Come during lunch as well. Not much of a wait so you'll be seated faster and you're just that much closer to ordering your Akamaru Modern. I come here strictly for their ramen, but their pork buns are really good too. It's a tie between here and David Chang. Both are equally good to me.   \n",

I took everyones advice on here and went with the modern ramen dish. It was soooo great, highly recommended! Also the pork buns were fantastic!!! Two $$ signs is kind of stretching it, not that inexpensive... I would definitely say it is a $$$ place, I paid $31 for ramen, pork buns, tax and tip, with no drink.... But well worth it!!! Can't wait to go back again! :-)   \n",

I thought Ippudo was not worth the Wait, Was not worth to eat. Tonight, You surprised me with the Pork Bun. With their Special sauce and mayo that made me had an orgasmic taste in my MOUTH. Miso Ramen $ 15.00 (with extra egg for $ 2.00).  Took one star down because the pork at Totto was better than here.  Everything else was good,  ALSO a big scoop of garlic was in the center of the bowl (Which I don't recommend you to use all of them) The soup was pretty good that I was able to zip half of the bowl (compare to other ramen places this was not salty). An incredible experience that I'm not sure if I can handle you again Ippudo (this time waited less than 30 minutes because it was before 7 PM dinner time).  Service was superb!, Everyone was super friendly and also NOTED me that if I was not able to finish my meal (my pork bun), I wa...   \n",

The decor and layout is great, and for a place that essentially serves a fancy version of what I ate every day during freshman year of college, its pretty damn good. But in a city like this, there are so many other places you can go without having to wait 2 hours for a table for ramen of equal or greater quality. The only thing here that's worth that wait - the pork buns. Scratch the ramen, get yourself two orders of the pork buns (it comes with 2 pieces), and your 2-hour wait will have been worth it!   \n",

I think you changed your noodles and got rid of my favorite ramen to date, and I never found it again after that first time I had it. Sorry Ippudo, you've just lost some of your sparkle for me. Also having to wait ~90 minutes most nights is kind of getting ridiculous. However, I am still a huge fan of the pork buns. I'd eat 3 orders of them myself if I could.   \n",

They only have larger tables so if you are a smaller group be prepared to sit next to and with others.  The servers were very attentive and knew the menu very well.  During lunch they had this \"lunch box\" type option where we were able to order a ramen with a side order, i.e. unagi don or fried chicken over rice. I guess I should've started off by stating that I am not fond of ramen ... or any soup for that matter.  But because of all the hype I thought I should just give it a shot -- and needless to say I was quite impressed. The ramen was very tasty and, much to my surprise, I ate till I was actually full.  Being that I am an extremely picky person, I would rather starve than eat something I don't like =X.  However, I must admit that I did enjoy my \"side order\" of unagi don more.  Oh, and the pork/chicken buns were great!   \n",

              "2011-11-14  OK OK , everyone, don't get angry. I liked Ippudo, but didn't think it was that exciting. The depth of flavor of the salad dressing on the salad portion of the lunch set, was more interesting than my Wasabi Shoyu Ramen, which is disappointing to say the least. The Ramen dish arrived with one of each of the tasty bits promised on the menu, but noodles themselves were plentiful and pretty good. I've had better noodles though at Hung Ry, Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles, or Terakawa. I didn't really taste any wasabi, so I added some of my friend's spicy paste. I needed a kick... The bean curd was particularly disappointing since it was just a piece of inari. The Grilled Eel in the lunch set was very tender and quite a highlight, and the rice was very sweet and starchy, like Japanese rice should be. Honestly, I think I enjoyed my  lunch set more than the main event. My friends had the Pork Buns, which they said had mayo in it, which made it very strange. Also, $9 for two \"buns\" (they're more ...   \n",

From the greeting upon entering to the decor. And lets not forget about the main reason, the Ramen! There are about seven types to choose from and each one has its own distinct flavors but all so good. It is a little pricy for ramen and the waits can get ridculous but i think its well worth it.   \n",

Don't fret if you're starving though, grab a couple of beers, order some pork buns to tide you over and wait... lunch sets are pretty good value, and if you come around 10pm, you usually don't have to wait that long.   \n",
              "2011-11-21  I strongly advise you to NOT come here on a weekend during prime lunch/dinner hours. I tried coming to Ippudo's on a Saturday at 6pm, and the hostess informed me that we wouldn't be seated until 10:30. 4.5 hours, are you KIDDING ME? So we ended up leaving and came back at noon on the following Monday, and waited a little under 5 minutes. Service here was great! Our waiter was very friendly and since he knew it was our first time he went through his personal recommendations and was really helpful in helping us pick what ramens to order. A MUST: Get the pork buns, you won't be disappointed. I actually think I enjoyed the pork buns more than my ramen. We had the Classic, Akamaru, and the Special (Wasabi broth) ramen. The one that really stood out to me was the special with the wasabi broth; the wasabi flavor added a kick. The noodles were cooked perfectly, I just wish they would put more ingredients into each serving, I think I only got 2 small and thin pieces of pork in my bowl. I th...   \n",

To me, this place is more form than substance.  It's a scene. Food quality gets a mixed review.  The noodles were a disappointment - kinda thin and not very chewy.  The broth, on the other hand, was absolutely fantastic.  Short ribs were also delicious, melted off the bone...but since this is a ramen place, noodles get more weight in the rating.   \n",

So, if you want to eat dinner at 8, go in a few hours before and put your name down, then arrive at 7:45. They'll most likely seat you late, but it beats a 2 hour wait.   \n",
              "2011-11-27  Ippudo has quickly distinguished itself from other ramen joints in the city and seems to stand a solid notch above the rest - judging by its out-the-door lines and the crazed fervor with which its devotees gush about the perfect springiness of its hand-pulled noodles, sublime porkiness of its broth, and Momofuku-rivaling pork buns. Here's the lowdown: by now you have hopefully deduced that that you will not find the likes of cup o' noodle or Maruchan instant noodles here.  You will find traditional Japanese items, such as miso and soy sauce ramen, agedashi, tonkatsu, and ochazuke...as well as more playful and trendy items like glazed chicken wings and the aforementioned pork buns. Ippudo does fatty pork very well, and the sticky unctuousness of it all leaves you simultaneously regretful and craving more.  The pork adds an otherworldly dimension to the stock used in the ramen soup.  Try some of the traditional additions to cut the rich flavor and give just the right touch of sour or...   \n",

The place was really crowded when we came in, I heard the hostess tell a guest for two it might be an hour and a half wait. I came in when it opened to make reservations for 7 at 6:30, arrived promptly at the reserved time, and was seated in less than 10 minutes. Akamaru modern has a fantastic deep broth flavor, the Kagashi Shoyu ramen was a little too salty for my taste. The regular pork was decent in tenderness and fat content. The braised pork belly was more tender and much much more fatty. Soft boiled egg was cooked well and the noodles, although thin to my liking, were good in texture and consistency. Pork buns were the highlight of the meal; fatty pork and interesting mayo sauce. Overall, welldone.   \n",

              "2011-12-05  Plan to have lunch early so you can be in line before the sign goes up and the doors open. A quarter before 11am, people are ready to slurp their noodle soup and is Ippodu ready to let them have it. At first I asked the waiter to bring me a bowl of Shiromaru Hakata Classic, but then I realized the Ippudo special was in my face asking me to try its cheesy-miso goodness. Thankfully I remembered because the Ippudo special unique blend of salty parmesan and strong miso made my bowl of ramen real exciting to eat! They couldn't make the soup shovels any bigger to enjoy your bowl of soup. And with an extra $3, I made myself a lunch special adding a small salad and spicy fried chicken over a bowl of rice. Ippudo is not serving you 10 for $1 ramen. Don't forget the Hirata Pork buns--they are spicy, sweet, salty, soft, and gone within minutes of being served. The space is clean and contemporary with a huge shape of a tree made of bamboo stalks by the kitchen. When the host brings in new gues...   \n",

              "2011-12-08      This place was great!  You've got to love a place that serves almost nothing but ramen and the servers walk around wearing \"I Heart Ramen\" shirts.  The ramen is expensive ($14-17) but delicious.  I had the Akamaru Modern - a giant bowl of mild but richly flavorful broth with roast pork and a heap of miso paste.  The pork must have been roast pork belly - it was so tender, succulent, and rich, without being too fatty.  Yum. I also love the GIANT spoons that come with the ramen - they were about 3 inches in diameter, had a hook at the end of the spoon to prevent the ramen from sliding into the bowl, and your spoon came with its very own spoonrest.   The pork buns were very good, but not as good as Momofuku's.  The pork belly was deliciously tender, but I missed the sweet hoison and pickled cucumber, and I could swear the buns were less soft and delicate. That said, still delicious.   I'd have a tough time deciding whether this place's ramen beats Momofuku's - they're both top notch!   \n",

During the 45 minute wait, I hung out at the bar and drank a bottle of sake with my brother and my fiance. Once we were done with the bottle it was time to get seated. A Right when you walk into the restaurant, you can tell this place is very trendy. I ordered the Akamaru Modern with all of the toppings. This was very delightful and the soup was as delicious it gets. I've tried as many ramen places in Houston and in New York and Ippudo is definitely on the upper echelon of ramen places in the US (...I want to go to Japan...) Being a trendy place the price is obviously a little on the higher side. Almost $20 for that bowl of ramen...but it was worth it on a cold rainy night in NYC.

(We had to have a second order, too) Ramen met my expectations. I tried my friend's but the one I ordered was the best: Miso Ramen. Ippudo has the best appetizers though a bit small. I recommend the Ippudo Salad and Tako Wasabi.   \n",
              "2011-12-18  I have to say....second time around with 2 years since my last visit and I think the food has gone downhill. MAJORLY DOWNHILL. Ramen has become a very trendy food....cause it's DELICIOUS when it's done right. For as simple as this dish may be, the broth is key to the whole dish. You get that wrong and it's all show. When I lived in LA I ate ramen once a week in several places around Little Japan and Downtown LA. So when I was in NY and wanted some ramen, I found Ippudo on Yelp and my friend and I ventured to try it. I remember the ramen being REALLY REALLY good. Cut to my most recent visit to New York, and now, this place is all the rage....so being on my own with a pretty decent hangover I got there at 11am and was seated right away. I ordered the PORK BUNS and the AKUMARA MODERN Ramen. If you have ever had the pleasure of eating pork buns at Momofuku, don't bother ordering them at Ippudo....waste of calories.

It defies the logic of having ramen, which is supposed to be fast food.  So we were walking around the area on a saturday evening and it was 15 min to opening time and we figured we might as well give it a try. We got in promptly 15 min later.  And I must say the ramen was very good. The broth was rich and flavorful. It is definitely not the typical ramen that one would get in Japan. There were special touches to the recipes and one gotta go to a specialty ramen shop even in Japan to have this type of flavors.   So was it worth a 15 min wait? Definitely. But anything over 30 minutes I would give it a pass, because, at the end of the day its just ramen.   \n",

Also, if you're in need to get a bowl but don't want to wait, try around 2:30pm during a weekday. It's not so crowded.   \n",

Came in a bit skeptical, despite rave reviews from family and friends, but coming from California, we had tasted some of the best, including Daikokuya, Santouka, and Shin-sen-gumi.  We were first impressed with the beautiful decor but really, who cares about decor, its all about the ramen.  And it didnt disappoint.  Kevin got the Hakata Ramen Lunch Set C, which comes with a bowl of fried spicy chicken and a salad, while Shuinn got the Karaka Men.  Both were outstanding, and were happy to say that it was the BEST ramen either of us have ever had.  (except in Japan).  The finishing touch was a nice complimentary cup of green tea at the end of the meal to cleanse the palate and soak up the delicious ramen juices.  We look forward to coming back whenever we're in town.   \n",
              "2011-12-29  I'm giving this 3 stars only because of the pork buns.  Otherwise, it would've been a 1 star for me. The wait is ridiculous -- we got there at 1 and they said we wouldnt get a table till 3:30... so we made reservationsfor 6:30 (they don't take reservations over the phone -- just in person... pretty dumb rule). But that wasn't the issue.  Not at all, I'm used to waiting long hours for good food. We get there at 6 and they said our table would be ready later.  That's fine.  We chill at the bar and have some beers and order some pork buns. The pork buns... are amazing.  $9 for 2 of them, but it's well worth it.  The buns are so perfect and the pork inside is amazing.  The sauce is just godly.  The pork could be a bit more tender, but it's still great.  Cool.  Cool.  Good stuff... 6:30 comes by.  They estimate 6:50.  Okay.  That's fine. 6:50 comes by... they say not yet. 7:15 comes by... they finally come. Okay, 45 minutes after our reservation... not too bad.  At least the world famou...   \n",
              "2011-12-30  As a person grown up to love noodles, I must say that they were pretty good. But  if you are a party of 3 or 5, forget it. The restaurant, designed for communal seating, only seats tables of 2 and 4 in a prompt and timely fashion. Any other seating arrangement you will be waiting for centuries. Even if a couple arrives way after you have, they will be in and out the door way before you are seated. We went knowing we had to wait, but after seeing couple after couple entering and exiting before we even got our chance i began questioning the hostesses method of wait times and seating. After kindly asking her why she was doing what she wAs doing, her rude , unprofessional and lack of consideration of customer service put ,e on the edge. To our experience even worse, we ended up with a greedy, selfish and inconsiderate waiter who believed that placing a bowl of noodles in front of you was fantastic service. Coming from the service industry myself, a tip is earned and reflects not ony yo...   \n",
